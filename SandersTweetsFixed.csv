"Ten years ago today, 20 children and 6 educators at Sandy Hook Elementary School were shot and killed. We must never forget that horrific day. It‚Äôs time for Congress to pass the common-sense gun safety reforms the American people are demanding."
I say to the greedy rail company CEOs who make millions a year on the backs of rail workers and give HUGE stock buybacks to their shareholders: It‚Äôs time to treat workers with respect and dignity.
"Today, I withdrew from consideration by the U.S. Senate my War Powers Resolution after the Biden administration agreed to continue working with my office on ending the war in Yemen."
I‚Äôm LIVE on the floor of the Senate NOW to discuss why the United States must end its involvement in the devastating Saudi-led war in Yemen.
"Millions uninsured or underinsured. 600,000 homeless. A dysfunctional child care system. Congress must focus on the needs of America‚Äôs working families instead of increasing the budget at the Pentagon where there is massive waste and fraud."
I sent a letter today with more than 70 of my colleagues in the House and the Senate urging President Biden to do everything within his power to guarantee rail workers the seven paid sick days that they desperately need.
"I applaud the FTC for moving to block this merger. In sector after sector, a handful of giant corporations control what is produced and how much Americans pay for their products. We must stop this dangerous concentration of ownership. This is a step in the right direction."
"After months of imprisonment, Brittney Griner is free and returning home to her family and loved ones. Thank you to President Biden and everyone who worked tirelessly to make this happen."
750 environmental and civil rights groups have told us that given the existential threat of climate change it is incredibly reckless to build a new fracked gas pipeline and expand fossil fuel extraction across the country. I agree. This provision must not become law.
I wanted to take a minute to talk with you about what we learned from the fight for paid sick days for rail workers.
"Kanye West praising Hitler and Nazis is abhorrent and disgusting. Whether it is anti-Semitism, racism, xenophobia, sexism or homophobia there are always those who want to divide us up. Our job is to unite people around a progressive agenda that improves life for all."
Let me be clear. This struggle is not over. I will do everything I can to make sure that rail workers in America are treated with dignity and respect.
I‚Äôm LIVE on the floor of the U.S. Senate to ask a simple question: Are any Republicans prepared to stand with rail workers who have ZERO paid sick days or are they instead going to back the outrageous greed of the rail industry?
Let me congratulate the 221 Members in the House for taking on the greed of the rail industry and voting to guarantee 7 paid sick days to every rail union worker in America. It is absolutely unacceptable that rail workers have ZERO paid sick days. The Senate must do the same.
Are any Republicans prepared to stand with rail workers who have ZERO paid sick days or are they going to back the greed of the top rail CEOs in America who got paid a combined $104 million in one year while they fire workers who get sick? Stay tuned...
"At a time of record profits in the rail industry, it‚Äôs unacceptable that rail workers have ZERO guaranteed paid sick days. I'm LIVE on the floor of the Senate NOW to demand a vote on guaranteeing 7 paid sick days for all rail workers."
I was proud to cast my vote today to pass the Respect for Marriage Act.
Guaranteeing 7 paid sick days to rail workers would cost the rail industry a grand total of $321 million a year ‚Äì less than 2% of its profits. Please don't tell me the rail industry can't afford it. Rail companies spent $25.5 billion on stock buybacks and dividends this year.
"At a time of record profits in the rail industry, it‚Äôs unacceptable that rail workers have ZERO guaranteed paid sick days. It‚Äôs my intention to block consideration of the rail legislation until a roll call vote occurs on guaranteeing 7 paid sick days to rail workers in America."
"It‚Äôs not just the unions who understand that working conditions on the railroads, with no guaranteed sick leave, is inhumane.It is some of the railroads major customers. Read what @EByerNACD, president and CEO of the National Association of Chemical Distributors, recently wrote."
"If the rail industry can afford to spend $25.5 billion this year to buy back its own stock and hand out huge dividends to its wealthy shareholders, please do not tell me it cannot afford to guarantee paid sick days to its workers and provide them with a decent quality of life."
"Jane and I want to wish everyone a safe and happy Thanksgiving. Let‚Äôs never forget that when we stand together, with hope and love, we can create the future based on peace and justice that we all deserve."
"Warren Buffett, the owner of BNSF Railway's parent company, became $1.38 billion richer yesterday. In one day, Mr. Buffett made twice as much money as it would cost to guarantee 15 paid sick days a year to every rail worker in America. The greed of the rail industry must end."
"Another day, another terrible mass shooting in America. ENOUGH IS ENOUGH. It is long overdue for Congress to pass the common sense gun safety reform that Americans are demanding. If we can‚Äôt get 60 votes in the Senate, then we must end the filibuster to protect our people."
Listen to what rail workers have to say about the appalling conditions they work under.
Let‚Äôs be clear. The terrible shooting in Colorado Springs this weekend is a direct result of the hateful and violent rhetoric that has been allowed to grow in this country. We must stand united with the LGBTQ+ community and speak out against bigotry everywhere we find it.
"Thank you, @SpeakerPelosi, for all that you have done and worked for throughout your years of dedicated service. Speaker of the House is no easy job and you should be proud of how much you have accomplished for the American people."
"Maybe just maybe, the Supreme Court should realize they have no business telling anyone who they can and can't love and marry. I was proud to cast my vote today to finally make marriage equality ‚Äì including same-sex and interracial marriages ‚Äì the long overdue law of the land."
"Let me congratulate the 1,200 physicians at Montefiore Health System who are forming a union. More than 40 years after their rights to unionize were taken away, they are standing up and fighting back for better working conditions and better patient care."
"Why have insulin prices soared? Just 3 companies (Eli Lilly, Novo &amp; Sanofi) control 90% of the insulin market while jacking up prices in tandem. It's time to break up their patents and end this collusion. Americans should not be forced to pay 10x more for insulin than Canadians."
"On Friday, we came together in St. Albans to commemorate the legacy and the extraordinary sacrifice of our Vermont veterans and their families."
"Cost for one vial of insulin:
üá¶üá∫: $6.94
üá¨üáß: $7.52
üá´üá∑: $9.08
üá©üá™: $11
üá®üá¶: $12
üáØüáµ: $14.40
üá∫üá∏: $98.70

No one should be forced to take out their wallets for insulin ‚Äì a life-saving drug that was invented nearly 100 years ago. It's time to end the greed of the pharmaceutical industry."
"I very much enjoyed being in St. Albans, Vermont today celebrating Veterans Day. Great turnout and community support. As the former chairman of the Senate Veterans Committee I want to thank all veterans for their service to our country."
"I stand in solidarity with @CCWUnited workers striking at Maximus call centers today. If Maximus can afford to pay its CEO 208 times his median worker and spend $2 million on ""bonuses"" to cross the picket line, it can afford to pay workers a fair wage."
"Oil Profits So Far This Year

Exxon:‚¨ÜÔ∏è203% to $43 billion
Chevron:‚¨ÜÔ∏è175% to $29 billion
BP:‚¨ÜÔ∏è161% to $22.8 billion
Shell:‚¨ÜÔ∏è133% to $30 billion

Big Oil is using the war in Ukraine as an excuse to make obscene profits by jacking up gas prices. Yes. We need a windfall profits tax."
"President Biden is right. At a time when Exxon, Shell and Chevron increased their profits by 168% to $81 billion in the last 2 quarter by charging outrageously high prices at the pump, we need a windfall profits tax. The revenue should go directly back to the American people."
"Today, the people of Brazil have voted for democracy, workers‚Äô rights and environmental sanity.I congratulate Lula on his hard fought victory and look forward to a strong and prosperous relationship between the United States and Brazil."
"Profits in last 2 quarters
Exxon:‚¨ÜÔ∏è228% to $38 billion
Chevron:‚¨ÜÔ∏è149% to $23 billion
Shell:‚¨ÜÔ∏è117% to $21 billion

These companies are spending $63 billion in stock buybacks &amp; dividends - a massive transfer of wealth from the working class to the top 1%. Windfall profits tax NOW!"
Many international studies point to Finland as the happiest country on Earth. Here‚Äôs what Finland‚Äôs Ambassador had to say when I asked him why that might be:
I wish Paul Pelosi a quick recovery from this heinous attack. Violence must have no place in American politics. I hope we can all come together to condemn the increasingly violent rhetoric we hear every day.
"Corporate greed is Shell making a record $21 billion in profits over the last 2 quarters and spending $26 billion on stock buybacks and dividends this year to enrich its wealthy stockholders while working class Americans struggle to pay $4, $5, $6 for a gallon of gas."
"Jamie Dimon became a billionaire after his bank was fined billions for mortgage fraud, illegally foreclosing on military families &amp; bribing foreign officials. Now, he's in Saudi Arabia to do business with a country partnering with Russia to damage our economy. Pathetic."
"While the price of a bag of Snickers has more than doubled, Republicans want to give the Mars family, who became 44% richer during the pandemic and are now worth $106 billion, a tax break of up to $42 billion by repealing the estate tax. Yes. Trickle down economics is very scary."
Millions of Americans are right now struggling with the outrageous cost of child care and education in this country. But it doesn‚Äôt have to be that way. Listen to what Finland‚Äôs Ambassador had to say about what it looks like when a nation gets its priorities right.
"This week, I had the chance to speak with the Finnish Ambassador and I asked him what can the U.S. learn from Finland? You can watch our full conversation here:"
"After receiving billions in federal contracts, Pfizer wants to charge up to $130 for a COVID vaccine shot that costs as little as $1.18 to manufacture ‚Äì 10,000% above cost. Enough is enough. The COVID vaccine should cost $0. Pfizer's greed is killing people throughout the world."
"While the cost of Halloween candy has surged more than 13.1% since last September, the Mars candy bar family became 44% richer during the pandemic increasing their wealth by $32.6 billion. The Mars family is now worth $106.8 billion.

Do you know what‚Äôs scary? Corporate greed."
"Corporate profits are at a 70-year high, median wages have gone down the sharpest in 25 years and corporations are spending $1 trillion on stock buybacks. Our goal must not be to ""get wages down."" Our goal must be to end corporate greed. The Fed must stop raising interest rates."
"It's outrageous that multinational corporations are demanding billions in new corporate tax breaks, including $2 billion for Raytheon. Instead, at a time when child poverty is spiking, we need to focus on supporting low-income families by extending the expanded child tax credit."
"Inflation Rate
üá™üá∫: 10.9%
üá©üá™: 10.9%

üá™üá∏: 9%
üáÆüá™: 8.6%
üá∫üá∏: 8.2%

No. Inflation is not going up in the U.S. because the working class got a $1,400 check 19 months ago. Multinational corporations are jacking up prices worldwide."
Join us tonight LIVE at 8 p.m. EST!
"President Biden‚Äôs Student Loan Debt Relief application is now open, and it takes less than five minutes to apply. This is a MAJOR first step. Next step: Make education a fundamental right for all, not a privilege for the wealthy few.

Apply today:"
"The inventors of insulin sold their patents for $1 in 1923. And yet, the price of insulin in America has gone up by over 1,000% since 1999 causing 1.3 million diabetics in our country to ration insulin last year. It should not cost 10x more for insulin than it does in Canada."
Apply for spring internships in Senator Sanders' Vermont and Washington DC offices. The deadline to apply is October 30. See here for more information:
"The Saudi Arabian regime treats women as third-class citizens, tortures civilians, and now is siding with Putin in the war against Ukraine. Yes, we must pull US troops out of Saudi Arabia, stop selling them weapons, and end its price-fixing oil cartel."
"Let me congratulate the Apple Store workers in Oklahoma City for voting to become the 2nd unionized Apple Store in the US. Last year, Apple made a record $95 billion profit. Its billionaire CEO made $99 million in 2021. It's time for Apple to treat its workers with respect."
"At a time when food prices are soaring as a result of corporate greed, it would be an absolute disaster to allow Kroger, the 2nd largest grocery store in America, to merge with Albertsons, the 4th largest grocery store in America. The Biden Administration must reject this deal."
"It's unacceptable that childcare workers are paid less than 98% of all occupations while childcare is unaffordable for 60% of families who need it. We must make pre-school free, make sure no family pays over 7% of their income on childcare &amp; pay childcare workers a living wage."
"I stand in solidarity with Teamsters Local 320 at the University of Minnesota in the fight for better wages &amp; working conditions. If UMN can afford to pay its president over $1 million and give her a 22% raise, it can afford to pay its workers a minimum wage of $20 an hour."
"We owe Native Americans an enormous debt. From the first days of this country, they were lied to, their treaties violated, and their needs ignored. Today, on Indigenous Peoples‚Äô Day, let us recommit to standing with them in the fight for long overdue justice."
"No, Chairman Powell. At a time when real weekly wages are lower today than they were nearly 50 years ago, the problem is not that wages and employment are too high. The problem is that corporations are making record profits by jacking up prices. We need a windfall profits tax."
"If Saudi Arabia, one of the worst violators of human rights in the world, wants to partner with Russia to jack up US gas prices, it can get Putin to defend its monarchy. We must pull all US troops out of Saudi Arabia, stop selling them weapons &amp; end its price-fixing oil cartel."
"I have long believed that marijuana should be legalized and those arrested for possession should be pardoned and have their records expunged. The President‚Äôs executive action today is an important step forward, but much more needs to be done."
"OPEC's decision to cutback on production is a blatant attempt to increase gas prices at the pump that cannot stand. We must end OPEC's illegal price-fixing cartel, eliminate military assistance to Saudi Arabia, and move aggressively to renewable energy."
"It takes enormous bravery to go to the streets to protest Iran‚Äôs authoritarian ‚ÄúSupreme Leader.‚Äù But, led by courageous young women, that‚Äôs exactly what‚Äôs happening.I stand with all of those Iranians who are demanding freedom and a better future."
Brazil‚Äôs next president should be chosen by the voters of that country and no one else. It‚Äôs an important step forward for democracy that Brazil‚Äôs military leadership made clear yesterday that they will respect the results of Sunday‚Äôs election.
"Yesterday, the United States Senate unanimously passed our resolution supporting free and fair elections in Brazil. We are sending a clear, bipartisan message that we are on the side of the people of Brazil and on the side of democracy."
Let me again thank the environmental community for helping to defeat the Big Oil side deal yesterday. But this battle is not over. The fossil fuel industry will spend millions to get Congress to approve some of their dirtiest projects before the year is over. We must stay alert.
I‚Äôm LIVE on the floor of the Senate to pass a resolution supporting free and fair elections in Brazil. It‚Äôs important for the people of Brazil to know that the United States is on their side and on the side of democracy.
The obscene level of income and wealth inequality in America is a profoundly moral issue that we cannot continue to ignore or sweep under the rug. A society cannot sustain itself when so few have so much while so many have so little.
"We already have redistribution of wealth in this country. It is going the wrong way in the form of trillions of dollars to the top 1%. Yes, I believe it is time to change that."
"I want to congratulate the groupsand organizations who made clear that we do not need more fossil fuel projects that would substantially increase carbon emissions. 

The removal of the big oil side deal is a victory for the planet and a major loss for the fossil fuel industry."
You want to restore people‚Äôs faith in democracy? Have a government that works for them.
"It may be a radical idea to some of my Senate colleagues &amp; in the editorial rooms of newspapers owned by Rupert Murdoch &amp; Jeff Bezos, but I do believe the future of the planet is more important than the short term profits of the fossil fuel industry. Defeat the Big Oil side deal."
A major challenge that our rural communities face today is the struggle to staff our volunteer fire departments and EMS crews. I am enormously proud of young people like Danielle who feel called to serve and who are stepping up to help keep their communities safe.
"The Iranian people, led by young women, are demonstrating for their freedom and for a better life. The government has responded by killing dozens of protesters. I call upon the Iranian government to address the needs of their citizens, not kill them."
"I sent a letter to my colleagues in the Senate today urging them to oppose this Big Oil side deal.

The time has come for Congress to tell the fossil fuel industry that their short-term profits are not more important than the future of our planet."
"Today, 50% of our people live paycheck to paycheck and half of older Americans have no savings. Meanwhile, CEOs of large corporations make a record-breaking 350 times what their workers earn.
 
That level of inequality is immoral and unsustainable."
"I stand in solidarity with the thousands of Russians who went into the streets yesterday to oppose Putin‚Äôs barbaric war in Ukraine. In an authoritarian society, that is an act of great courage. They deserve our support."
"LIVE: This month, I introduced a resolution with my colleagues supporting free and fair elections in Brazil. Shockingly, not a single Republican is supporting it. I‚Äôm on the floor of the Senate to talk about why."
The fact that ZERO Republicans are supporting a resolution to back free elections in Brazil tells us about the state of democracy in this country and the Republican Party. I‚Äôll be LIVE on the Senate floor tonight at 7:15 p.m. ET to talk about it.
We must put an end to corporate greed and support the growing union movement.
"Let me congratulate the Starbucks workers in Boston who won their 64-day strike for fair schedules and decent working conditions. When workers stand together and fight for justice, there is nothing they cannot accomplish. I was proud to have stood on the picket line with them."
"During this terrible pandemic, when thousands of essential workers died doing their jobs, some 700 billionaires in America became nearly $2 trillion richer. But the working class is standing up and fighting back."
No. Defeating the Big Oil side deal is not about revenge. It's about whether we will stand with 650 environmental and civil rights organizations who understand that the future of the planet is with renewable energy and energy efficiency not approving the Mountain Valley Pipeline.
The entire island of Puerto Rico lost power and 60% of households still don't have clean running water. The full resources of the U.S. government must be brought to bear to address the suffering of our fellow citizens.
"Yesterday, Republicans tried to ram through a bill that would have prevented rail workers from receiving sick leave and health care benefits. I was proud to block that effort on the floor of the Senate. If you missed it, tune in now."
Let me congratulate the rail unions who stood up to corporate greed and forced the industry to make important concessions. I also want to thank President Biden and Secretary Walsh for their hard work. Now it‚Äôs up to the rank-and-file union members to evaluate this deal.
"Call me a radical, but I happen to believe that rail workers are entitled to paid sick leave."
I‚Äôm LIVE on the floor of the U.S. Senate to stand with rail workers as they fight for paid sick leave and improved working conditions from rail companies that made $20 billion in profits last year.
"Today, Republicans at 4:20 p.m. ET will try to sneak legislation through the U.S. Senate to block 115,000 rail workers from fighting for paid sick days and safe working conditions. 

I will proudly stand up to stop it."
"In the midst of a potential rail strike, Warren Buffett, the owner of BNSF Railway's parent company, worth $100 billion must intervene. During the pandemic, Mr. Buffett became $36 billion richer. He must ensure that rail workers receive decent wages and safe working conditions."
"This poll confirms what we already know: Our current health care system is a disaster. At a time when we are the only major country not to guarantee health care as a right, just 12% of Americans believe our health care system is working very well. Yes. We need Medicare for All."
LIVE: The American people are sick and tired of our collapsing and dysfunctional health care system. Now is the time for Medicare for All.
I‚Äôll be live on the floor of the U.S. Senate at 3 p.m. ET TODAY to discuss our collapsing health care system and why we need Medicare for All.
"On the 60th anniversary of John F. Kennedy‚Äôs famous speech and as a couple of billionaires look to exploit space for their own gain, let us not forget his proclamation that space advancements be ‚Äúwon and used for the progress of all people,‚Äù not just the wealthy few."
"Today, we pause to remember the nearly 3,000 lives lost on September 11, 2001 and honor the brave first responders who risked their lives that day to help their fellow Americans. It‚Äôs a day I will never forget."
I‚Äôm once again asking my colleagues in the Senate to look at what is happening around the world and find the courage to stand up to the fossil fuel industry.
"Today, 72 Members of Congress made it clear that it would be an outrage to attach Sen. Manchin's fossil fuel ""side deal"" to the Continuing Resolution or any other must pass bill. At a time when our planet is on fire, we must take on the greed of Big Oil &amp; reject this dirty deal."
"Yesterday, I was on the Senate floor to discuss climate catastrophes are happening all over the world and why we must not make it easier for the fossil fuel industry to destroy our planet. If you missed it, tune in."
"It's no accident that 71% of Americans have a favorable view of unions the highest since 1965, while just 36% hold a favorable view of corporations the lowest since Wall Street crashed the economy in 2008. The American people are sick and tired of corporate greed."
"Congress must listen to the 650+ environmental and civil rights organizations who wrote that it would be ""morally abhorrent"" to attach Sen. Manchin‚Äôs fossil fuel ""side deal"" to the Continuing Resolution or any other must pass bill."
Combating climate change is more important than fossil fuel profits. I will not vote for any bill that makes it easier for Big Oil to destroy the planet and that includes approving the Mountain Valley Pipeline. The Continuing Resolution must not be held hostage by Big Oil.
I‚Äôm LIVE on the floor of the U.S. Senate to announce my strong opposition to the so-called ‚Äúside deal‚Äù to build the Mountain Valley Pipeline. We don‚Äôt need to make it easier for the fossil fuel industry to destroy the planet.
TODAY at 11am ET: I‚Äôll be LIVE on the floor of the U.S. Senate to speak about how climate change is already ravaging our planet and why now is not the time to fast-track the construction of a natural gas pipeline in West Virginia. Tune in.
Congrats to Minor League baseball players for a huge and swift show of support for forming a union. The MLB and Commissioner Manfred should voluntarily recognize the union immediately and bargain in good faith.
"On this Labor Day, let us not forget that the total wealth of the top 1% reached a record $45.6 trillion at the end of the fourth quarter of 2021. That‚Äôs more money than the bottom 90% of our country. We need an economy that works for all, not just the few."
"What recent union victories show is that working class Americans are sick and tired of being exploited by large corporations. This Labor Day, let us stand together in the fight for justice."
We must stand up to the ruling class.
"If we can afford to give out tax breaks for the rich and large corporations, we can afford to address the needs of the working class. Period."
Let us have the courage to stand together and fight back against corporate greed. Let us fight back against massive income and wealth inequality. Let us fight back against a corrupt political system.
"The threats to our democracy could not be clearer, and we must act boldly to protect it."
"We will not allow Republicans to divide us up between those working class Americans who went to college and left deeply in debt against those who did not. All of us need to stand together for an economy that works for all, not just the 1%."
"Never Forget: 

83% of the Trump tax breaks are going to the top 1%.

87% of Biden's student loan benefits are going to individuals making $75,000 or less and 0% are going to the top 1%.

Yes. It's about time we stood up for working class families."
"House Republicans: ""If you take out a loan, you pay it back.""

Meanwhile: 13 House Republicans took out over $15 million in PPP loans that were totally forgiven by the federal government.

House Republicans: If you take out a loan, you pay it back."
"This is what a leading Republican thinks of young ""slacker"" Americans who took out loans to go to college."
"I hear Republicans complaining about $20,000 in student debt forgiveness. Funny, I didn't hear those complaints when Trump declared bankruptcy 6 times &amp; had $287 million in loans forgiven by big banks. The GOP l-o-v-e-s socialism for the rich, rugged individualism for the rest."
"If Howard Schultz, the Starbucks CEO, who is worth $4 billion can afford a $145 million, 254-foot super yacht with a helicopter pad, you know what? He can afford to negotiate a fair first contract with Starbucks workers who voted to form a union in over 230 locations in America."
My statement on President Biden‚Äôs student debt announcement.
"The average amount of debt forgiveness to businesses receiving PPP loans: $95,700. If we could afford to cancel hundreds of billions in PPP loans to business owners in their time of need, please do not tell me we can't afford to cancel all student debt for 45 million Americans."
"More corporate greed. While the cost of healthcare is soaring &amp; over 70 million are uninsured or under-insured, 7 health insurance companies made $43.8 billion in profits in the first half of 2022 while spending over $12 billion on stock buybacks. Yes. We need Medicare for All."
"We‚Äôve been dealing with Covid-19 for years now. That‚Äôs difficult. No way around it. Last week, I spoke with White House COVID-19 Response Coordinator @AshishKJha46 about where we go from here. If you missed it, tune in NOW!"
"This is what a rigged economy looks like. On the same day a bill was signed into law to give a $76 billion blank check to micro-chip companies, Intel announced it will be cutting back on plans to increase jobs by $4 billion while increasing dividends for its wealthy shareholders."
"TONIGHT: I had a very good discussion last week with White House COVID-19 Response Coordinator @AshishKJha46 about where we are with the pandemic and where we go from here. If you missed it, we are rebroadcasting it tonight at 7pm ET!"
"For 87 years, through good times and bad, Social Security has paid every benefit owed to every eligible American on time &amp; without delay. That's a h-u-g-e record of accomplishment. On this, the 87th anniversary of Social Security, our job is to expand Social Security, not cut it."
"I‚Äôm LIVE now with White House COVID-19 Response Coordinator @AshishKJha46 to answer your questions about what‚Äôs happening with the pandemic, what the future may hold, and some of the best ways to stay safe and healthy."
"The United States should stand for democracy and support free and fair elections. To that end, we must make absolutely clear that it will not support any government that comes to power in Brazil through undemocratic means."
5pm ET TONIGHT: Tune in here for a livestream Q&amp;A discussion with me and White House COVID-19 Response Coordinator @AshishKJha46. We‚Äôll be answering your questions on what‚Äôs happening with the pandemic and the best ways to stay safe and healthy.
"The ""Inflation Reduction Act"" is a very small step forward. Standing together we can do better. We must do better. Tune in to hear what I said on the Senate floor this weekend."
"TUNE IN 5pm ET TONIGHT: As you may know, the Senate passed the Inflation Reduction Act on Sunday. The vote was 51-50. I voted for it.

There are good things and bad things about this bill. Here's what I said on the floor of the Senate.

Tune in 5pm ET this evening to hear more."

"2nd Quarter Profits
Exxon: $17.9 billion - highest ever
Chevron: $11.62 billion - highest ever
Shell: $11.5 billion - highest ever
BP: $8.5 billion - highest in 14 years

The UN Secretary General is right: This ""grotesque greed"" is destroying the planet and punishing the poor."
"Today the Inflation Reduction Act passed the Senate 51-50. In my view, this legislation goes nowhere near far enough for working families, but it does begin to address the existential crisis of climate change. It‚Äôs an important step forward and I was happy to support it."
"I‚Äôm LIVE now to make this clear: If all 50 members of the Democratic Caucus were to stand together today, we could pass some very important amendments to profoundly improve the lives of working people and begin to restore faith in our democracy."
"The country‚Äôs biggest railroad companies made over $20 billion in profits last year, while rail workers haven‚Äôt seen a wage increase since 2019 and are currently without a contract. These workers deserve a fair contract and they deserve it NOW."
"These are tough times for workers, boom times for corporations. While prices soar, 3 pharmaceutical companies increased their profits by 90% to $54 billion. Last quarter, 3 Big Oil companies made a record $46 billion in profits. We must stand together against corporate greed."
"Recently, I had the opportunity to speak to a group of courageous young people from Israel and Palestine who are working to build a better, more peaceful future. As yet another round of conflict threatens to erupt, I urge you to listen to what they have to say."

Good luck, and congratulations! You‚Äôve made our whole state proud."
"I‚Äôm LIVE on the floor of the Senate to make clear that now is the time for MAJOR legislation that meets the needs of our people. Right now, the Inflation Reduction Act falls short of that goal."
"At a time of massive income inequality, at a time when we face the existential threat of climate change, at a time when millions of families are struggling, now is the time to study the so-called ‚ÄúInflation Reduction Act‚Äù and come up with amendments as to how we can improve it."
"The 700-page so-called Inflation Reduction Act, after months of secret negotiations, became public late last week. Now is the time for every member of the Senate to study this bill thoroughly and to come up with amendments and suggestions as to how we can improve it."
"LIVE: I‚Äôm on the floor of the U.S. Senate to discuss the so-called ‚ÄúInflation Reduction Act"" and I want to put the bill into the context of where we are as a nation."
"As a former chair and longtime member of the Senate Veterans‚Äô Affairs Committee, I‚Äôm proud that we are sending the PACT Act to the President‚Äôs Desk. It is the most comprehensive expansion of health care for our nation‚Äôs veterans in a generation."

POSTPONED: Tonight‚Äôs livestreamed Q&amp;A discussion with the White House‚Äôs COVID-19 Response Coordinator Dr. Ashish Jha is postponed. We will be announcing a new date and time soon!
"TOMORROW: Join me at 5pm ET for a livestreamed Q&amp;A discussion with the White House‚Äôs COVID-19 Response Coordinator @AshishKJha46. We will discuss what's going on now with the pandemic, what the future may hold, and the best ways to stay safe and healthy."
"I say to Senator Toomey, if you don't believe we can afford to take care of our veterans suffering from toxic burn pit exposure, then you should not have approved funding to go to war. Taking care of our veterans is the cost of war ‚Äì period. End of discussion."
"While you were feeling pain at the pump, Shell, Exxon, and Chevron raked in $46 BILLION in profits over the last three months and said they would spend up to $47 billion on stock buybacks after spending $18.8 billion so far this year. Yes, it‚Äôs time for a windfall profits tax."
"LIVE: My colleagues often say they‚Äôre concerned about the deficit. Well, if they‚Äôre really concerned, let us not give a $76 billion blank check to the highly profitable microchip industry with no protections at all for the American taxpayer."
"When it comes to giving blank checks to profitable microchip companies, some of my colleagues think we should just ‚Äújoin the club‚Äù and do what other countries are doing. Well, there are a few other clubs I think we should join instead."
LIVE: Some of my colleagues in the Senate want to give in to the extortion of the microchip industry and hand them a $76 billion blank check. I say instead let‚Äôs enact the agenda the American people want.
"Today at 4:30pm ET, I'll be on the floor of the Senate to once again talk about legislation that hands a $76 billion blank check to the microchip industry. Yes. We need to rebuild the microchip industry, but not in in a way that just benefits profitable corporations."
"Republicans talk about the cost of a Green New Deal.Really?If left unchecked, climate change, according to Deloitte, could cost the global economy $178 trillion over the next 50 years. Droughts, floods, extreme weather are expensive. Inaction is not a moral or economic option."
"Unbelievable! Not only are Republicans anti-choice but almost all of them in the House just voted against Americans, women and men, having the right to contraception. While the whole world laughs, they want to take us back to the 1800s. Ain't gonna happen."
"Pharma is spending millions to defeat a very modest drug pricing bill.Intel is spending millions to get a $20 billion handout.Joe Manchin, who is blocking climate action, is the major recipient of fossil fuel campaign contributions.This is how a corrupt political system works."
"A worker today would need to make nearly 3 times the minimum wage in order to afford an average one-bedroom apartment.

That makes no sense to me, nor do I think it makes sense to the American people."
"The function of a rational health care system is to provide quality care to all in a cost-effective way, not make billionaires like Jeff Bezos even richer. At a time of growing concentration of ownership, the Justice Department must denyAmazon's acquisition of One Medical."
"A worker today earning the federal minimum wage makes $1,257 a month.
The median rent for an apartment today is $1,362 a month.

Addressing the needs of the American people is not radical. What‚Äôs radical is doing nothing while families struggle."
The corporate lobbyists working on this bill are like pigs at the trough.
"Listen to the CEO of Intel tell you all you need to know about oligarchy, corporate arrogance, and the state of American politics. It sure sounds like extortion to me."
"LIVE: I‚Äôm not a lawyer, but what the CEO of Intel is saying to Congress sure sounds like extortion to me. No, I do not believe we need to provide the microchip industry with a blank check of over $76 billion."
"I'll be LIVE on the floor of the U.S. Senate at 4pm ET to explain why throwing billions of dollars at the profitable microchip industry, which over the last 20 years shut down hundreds of plants in the U.S. and eliminated 150,000 jobs, with no strings attached makes no sense."
"Record heatwaves worldwide. Hospitalizations, injuries, and deaths. Crops destroyed. Fires raging. 

Some say bold climate action is ""expensive."" Compared to what?"
"Sen. Manchin is intentionally sabotaging the President‚Äôs agenda, what the American people want, and what the majority of us in the Democratic caucus want.

He is not interested in representing the needs of the working class of this country."
"Yesterday, I met with a few brave human rights activists from the Middle East. Here‚Äôs what they had to say."
We must put an end to the unauthorized and unconstitutional involvement of U.S. Armed Forces in the catastrophic Saudi-led war in Yemen and Congress must take back its authority over war.
"Let me congratulate the Starbucks workers in South Burlington for successfully voting to form the first unionized Starbucks in Vermont. In just 8 months, workers in over 160 Starbucks shops have voted to form a union for better wages, benefits &amp; working conditions. Keep it up!"
Here‚Äôs my message to the 16% of Americans who approve of the job Congress is doing.
"We must become less dependent on foreign nations for microchips, but we can and must accomplish that goal without simply throwing money at these companies while the taxpayer gets nothing in return."
"LIVE: No, the microchip industry does not need a blank check of over $50 billion at a time when the companies are making billions of dollars in profits and paying their executives exorbitant compensation packages."
"I‚Äôll be LIVE on the floor of the Senate at 1:30pm ET to discuss why, at a time of massive wealth and income inequality, now is not the time for Congress to hand a $53 billion blank check to the microchip industry."
"On #PrimeDay, let's not forget. Amazon blamed ""inflation"" on a 17% price hike in a Prime membership after its profits soared 450% since the pandemic to a record $38 billion while avoiding $5 billion in taxes, spending $4 million on union busting &amp; denying workers paid sick leave."
"Today, in America, just three Wall Street firms ‚Äì BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street - manage $22 trillion in assets. These three firms are major shareholders in more than 96 percent of S&amp;P 500 companies.Obscene."
"Cherry Garcia. Phish Food. Chunky Monkey. Super Fudge Chunk. Ben &amp; Jerry not only revolutionized the world of ice cream, but they also showed the world what a progressive and community-minded business could look like."
"Average hourly wages for American workers have remained nearly flat since 1960, while home prices have almost TRIPLED over the same time period. It's no wonder that nearly half of all Americans today spend at least 30% of their income on housing. Obscene."
"Happy 4th of July! Let us recommit today to building a future that works for all of us, not just the few."
"I am proud of the major increase in Federally Qualified Community Health Centers in Vermont and the number of Vermonters who use them. 

While the struggle continues to guarantee health care to all, we have made significant progress in improving access to primary health care."
President Biden is right: The big oil companies must stop profiteering and bring down gas prices. But we need more than a tweet. It's time for the President to demand that Congress pass a windfall profits tax on Big Oil and use the revenue to provide rebates to consumers NOW!
"Average Price of a Gallon of Gas:
U.S.: $4.84
France: $8.11
Germany: $7.46
South Korea: $6.33
South Africa: $5.61
India: $4.99

The skyrocketing price of gas is not just an American problem. The greed of Big Oil CEOs is an international problem. We need a windfall profits tax."
"President Biden is absolutely right. Senate Democrats must end the filibuster and codify the right to an abortion NOW. If you allow the broken rules of the Senate to stand in the way of guaranteeing basic rights for our people, you don‚Äôt really stand for those rights."
"At a time when half of older Americans have no retirement savings and are worried about their ability to retire with dignity and millions of seniors are living in poverty, our job is not to cut Social Security. Our job must be to expand Social Security."
"The American people are sick of airlines ripping them off, canceling flights at the last minute and delaying flights for hours on end. It's time for @SecretaryPete to fine airlines $55,000 per passenger for every flight cancellation they know can‚Äôt be fully staffed."
"Big Oil's 1st Quarter Profit in 2022: $35 billion
Average Price of Gas today: $4.91

Big Oil's 1st Quarter Profit in 2019: $13.8 billion
Average Gas Price: $2.69

Big Oil's 1st Quarter Profit in 2015: $13.1 billion
Average Gas Price: $2.41

Yes. We need a windfall profits tax."
"Overturning Roe v. Wade and denying women the right to control their own bodies is an outrage and in defiance of what the American people want. Democrats must now end the filibuster in the Senate, codify Roe v. Wade, and once again make abortion legal and safe."
It‚Äôs time for a windfall profits tax.
"In 2020, 45,000 Americans died from gun-related injuries. We‚Äôve recently seen horrific mass shootings in Buffalo and Texas. The Supreme Court‚Äôs response: loosen gun safety laws. Six justices are way out of touch with reality."
"In the French elections, given the choice between progressives who want to increase taxes on the rich, or right-wing extremists who are viciously anti-immigrant, the pro-business ""centrist"" party of Macron just couldn't make a choice. There's a lesson to be learned here."
"Understanding the horrors and lasting legacy of slavery is a critical step to making the changes we need in our world today.
 
Today, on Juneteenth, we must recommit to building a nation based on justice and compassion."
$2.5 billion in federal funding went to Moderna. The company‚Äôs CEO then received a $926 million golden parachute. Does that make any sense to you?
"Last year, 3 of the biggest pharmaceutical companies in America ‚Äì Pfizer, Johnson &amp; Johnson and AbbVie ‚Äì increased their profits by 90 percent to $54 billion ‚Äì while half of the new brand name drugs now cost over $180,000. Obscene."
The Democratic Party cannot continue to ignore the needs of the working class of our country and expect to retain majority control in the US House and US Senate. It‚Äôs time to show which side we‚Äôre on. It‚Äôs time to start voting.
LIVE: I'm on the floor of the Senate to respond to Sen. Rand Paul's budget proposal that calls for tax breaks for the wealthy and massive cuts to programs the American people need.
"Today, someone who makes $147,000 a year pays the same amount of Social Security taxes as a millionaire or billionaire. Does that make sense to you?"
President Biden is absolutely right. The big oil companies are making obscene profits gouging working Americans at an unprecedented level. Democrats in Congress should support the president‚Äôs fight against their greed and enact a windfall profits tax NOW.
"Right now, there are 1,500 paid lobbyists from both parties in Washington working overtime to make sure we don‚Äôt represent our constituents who are dying and are sick and tired of paying outrageous prices for prescription drugs. What a disgrace."
"When I was a kid growing up in Brooklyn, I obsessively followed the Brooklyn Dodgers. As mayor of Burlington, I helped bring minor league baseball back to the city. Today's team is the @VTLakeMonsters and I had the honor of throwing out the first pitch on opening day this year."
"Ban the sale and distribution of assault weapons. Prohibit high-capacity magazines. Expand background checks. End the gun show loophole. If we can‚Äôt get 60 votes in the Senate, then we must end the filibuster."
Making Gaza's beaches safe forswimming is a small but important step in addressing Gaza's environmental and humanitarian crisis. We must continueto bring people together for these efforts in Palestine and across the region.
"Greed. Greed. Greed. Since 2008, the median price for new brand name drugs soared from $2,115 to $180,000 while 3 pharmaceutical companies made $54 billion in profits last year. How many more people need to die before Congress has the guts to take on the pharmaceutical industry?"
"The January 6th hearings remind us that politics today is not a debate over ideas. It's about whether we maintain our democratic form of government against those who propagate a Big Lie, violence and authoritarianism."
"It is absurd that a billionaire in America today pays the same amount of Social Security taxes as someone making $147,000 a year. It is time to scrap the cap, expand benefits, and fully fund Social Security."
"LIVE: At a time when half of older Americans have no retirement savings and millions of senior citizens are living in poverty, our job is to expand Social Security by demanding the wealthy pay their fair share."
"Let me be clear: Every American must be able to retire with dignity. Period.

Join me Tomorrow at 11 a.m. ET for a hearing in the Senate Budget Committee to discuss how we must save and expand Social Security ‚Äì not cut it."
Our nation‚Äôs veterans have earned quality health care. I‚Äôm LIVE on the floor of the Senate to urge my colleagues to strengthen the VA so no veteran is left behind.
"The time is long overdue to legalize marijuana nationally, expunge past marijuana convictions and ensure revenue from legal marijuana is reinvested in the communities most impacted by the failed war on drugs."
"In the richest country in the history of the world, no senior should live in poverty and every American should be able to retire in dignity after a lifetime of hard work. Yes, it‚Äôs time expand Social Security."
"I must confess that I love diners. I have not eaten at every diner in Vermont, but I've been to most. They're unpretentious, the food is good, the prices are right and the staff are friendly. Join us on a visit to the Blue Benn in Bennington."
"1 in 7 older Americans rely on Social Security for more than 90% of their income. Maybe, just maybe, instead of cutting Social Security, we should expand it."
The time for endless talk is over. We must vote on Build Back Better THIS MONTH. Let those who are opposed explain why. The vast majority in our caucus deserve a chance to show they can stand up to powerful special interests and represent working families. We must vote NOW.
"Sen. Manchin is right. Let‚Äôs cut drug prices in half by strengthening the provision in the House-passed Build Back Better legislation to allow Medicare to negotiate drug prices like the VA has done for years, and pass the whole package with 50 votes next week. It's time to vote."
"Yes, it is more important to protect the babies of this country than the huge CEO compensation packages and stock buybacks of an infant formula company that lied to the FDA. That‚Äôs not a radical idea."
Cancel it. Every penny.
"Today, Memorial Day, we honor the brave men and women who gave their lives to defend our country. Their sacrifices will never be forgotten."
Congratulations to Starbucks Workers United for winning the 100th union election at Starbucks coffee shops all over America. I say to Howard Schultz: Stop the union busting. Obey the law. Negotiate a fair contract with your workers now ‚Äì no more delays. Enough is enough.
"Enough is enough. We must abolish the filibuster and pass gun safety legislation NOW. No one in America needs an AR-15. How many more children, mothers and fathers need to be murdered in cold blood before the Senate has the guts to ban assault weapons and take on the NRA?"
"It is tragic but unsurprising that Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny will be sent to prison for 9 years. Putin‚Äôs authoritarian regime cannot tolerate dissent, especially from someone who exposes the enormous wealth Putin and his cronies have stolen from the Russian people."
"The horrific rampage in TX once again makes clear that there are some very sick people in this country with guns in their hands who should not have them. Congress may not be able to end this problem, but we must at least pass commonsense gun reforms to finally protect the public."
"When I think about the gathering of billionaires at Davos at a time of obscene income and wealth inequality I recall what Dr. King said: ‚ÄúGod never intended for one group of people to live in superfluous inordinate wealth, while others live in abject deadening poverty.‚Äù"
"No government ‚Äì not the federal government, not the state government and not the city government ‚Äì should be handing out corporate welfare to union busters and labor law violators."
"The oligarchs in Davos party, the poor suffer. While 260 million people throughout the world will likely be pushed into extreme poverty this year ‚Äì trying to survive on less than $2 a day ‚Äì over 2,000 billionaires across the globe became $3.78 trillion richer during the pandemic."
"Per capita spending on health care:

üá®üá¶: $5,370
üá´üá∑: $5,564

üá∫üá∏: $12,530

How does it happen that we spend so much money for health care, but get so little in return?"
"This is what a rigged and corrupt system looks like.
 
Effective Tax Rate:
0.1%: Warren Buffett worth $111 billion
1.1%: Jeff Bezos worth $131 billion
1.8% Mike Bloomberg worth $82 billion
2.1%: Elon Musk worth $210 billion
13.5%: Registered Nurse
 
Yes. It's time to #TaxTheRich"
The loudest voices in the Republican Party demanding that women be forced to give birth against their will are exactly the same people who oppose virtually every effort here in Congress designed to improve life for children and their mothers.
"This act of domestic terrorism by a racist, anti-Semitic white supremacist using an AR-15 should be a call to action. 

Let us finally pass common sense gun safety reforms. We cannot grow numb to this violence, and we must show our nation can come together to address this hatred."
"No, Mr. Bezos. Disinformation is Amazon spreading anti-union propaganda &amp; forcing workers to attend illegal captive audience meetings. Disinformation is Amazon blaming a 17% price increase on ""inflation"" while making a record $35 billion in profits &amp; avoiding $5 billion in taxes."
"The attack by Israeli forces against mourners at the funeral of Palestinian journalist Shireen Abu Akleh is an outrage. The United States must condemn this, and demand an independent investigation into her killing."
"Greed. Greed. Greed. While Americans are struggling at the pump, in the first three months of this year, 21 oil and gas companies made over $41 billion in profits, more than double their profits from last year. The problem is not inflation. The problem is corporate greed."
"The United States has the most dysfunctional, inefficient, bureaucratic and expensive health care system in the world. It‚Äôs time for Medicare for All."
"It is not acceptable that 68,000 Americans die each year because they cannot afford the health care they desperately need. It‚Äôs time to end this international embarrassment. It‚Äôs time to guarantee health care in the United States to all. It‚Äôs time for Medicare for All."
"LIVE: No more insurance premiums. No more deductibles. No more co-payments. Health care is right, not a privilege. It‚Äôs time for Medicare for All."

"If you can‚Äôt stand up for a woman‚Äôs right to choose, for voting rights, for an economy that works for all, why are you caucusing with the Senate Democrats? We need a Democratic Majority where all members believe in economic, racial, social and environmental justice."
"It is no great secret that women throughout the history of our country have had to fight for their basic human rights against all forms of patriarchy, so today let us be absolutely clear: When it comes to women‚Äôs rights, we cannot go backwards. We must go forward."
I'm LIVE on the floor of the U.S. Senate to demand we end the filibuster and protect the constitutional right to have an abortion.
I'll be on the floor of U.S. Senate TONIGHT at 8pm ET to talk about why we must end the filibuster and protect the constitutional right to have an abortion.
"Estimates show that nearly 27 million Americans and their families lost their health care coverage when they lost their jobs due to COVID-19. Let me be clear: health care is a human right, not a job benefit. Yes. It‚Äôs time for Medicare for All."
We spend twice as much per capita on health care as any other nation but with worse health outcomes for our people. Does that make sense to anyone? It‚Äôs time for Medicare for All.
"If Republicans can end the filibuster to install right wing judges nominated by presidents who lost the popular vote in order to overturn Roe v. Wade, Democrats can and must end the filibuster to keep abortion legal and safe."
"This is what Oligarchy and corporate greed are all about. Two large and profitable corporations, owned by billionaires, spend millions to illegally deny their workers the right to organize. No corporation that breaks the law should get a federal contract."
"Congratulations to the resident doctors at UVM, UMass and Stanford who have voted, overwhelmingly, to unionize. These doctors believe its unfair to their patients and themselves when they are forced to work up to 80 hours a week at very inadequate pay.They're right."
Taxpayer dollars should not go to multibillion dollar companies that violate labor laws. Period.
"It may be news to @LindseyGrahamSC, but Amazon has a 150% percent turnover rate. Workers come into the warehouses, they are worked as hard as humanly possible, and they leave, often crushed. Is this really a business model that should be rewarded with federal contracts?"
Congratulations to President Biden for having the courage to do what no president in modern history has done. He is standing with union organizers who are helping to grow the trade union movement. This is an important step forward for working families. Let's go forward together.
"No government ‚Äì not the federal government, not the state government and not the city government - should be handing out corporate welfare to union busters and labor law violators."

"Clearly, Jeff Bezos, the second wealthiest person on the planet, desperately needs $10 billion from the American taxpayer to go to the moon. After all, he is only worth $150 billion."
"We have strange priorities in the Senate.

We can‚Äôt extend the child tax credit. 

We can‚Äôt deal with the crisis in child care. 

We can‚Äôt take on climate change. 

But somehow we can provide a massive amount of corporate welfare to a handful of corporations. Totally absurd."
"If Mr. Bezos wants to go to the moon, wants to go to Mars, wants to go to Saturn, that‚Äôs his right. But he does not have the right to ask the taxpayers of this country for $10 billion to help him make his trip to outer space."
"In my view, it makes zero sense for Congress to hand a $52 billion check to the microchip industry, no strings attached. This is an industry that said ‚ÄòHey, let‚Äôs throw hundreds of thousands of American workers out on the street to make more money in low-wage countries.‚Äô Absurd."
"Congress must pass legislation that codifiesRoe v. Wadeas the law of the land in this country NOW. And if there aren‚Äôt 60 votes in the Senate to do it, and there are not, we must end the filibuster to pass it with 50 votes."
Eid Mubarak to all of our Muslim friends around the world.
"At a time when over half of the people in this country live paycheck to paycheck, should we really be providing a multibillion-dollar taxpayer bailout for Bezos to fuel his space hobby? I don‚Äôt think so. The Senate will hold a vote this week to stop it."

In the US, 58% of McDonald's workers make less than $12 an hour &amp; no benefits while its CEO makes $20 million. Every worker needs a union. #MayDay2022"
"While Vermont continues to lead the nation in syrup production, many studies are telling us that the climate crisis is threatening the industry.

Now, more than ever, it‚Äôs important that we protect not only our planet, but also long-held and beloved practices, like sugaring."
"I want wish each and every one of you a very happy May Day. When working people in our country and around the world come together, there is nothing that can stop us in the struggle for justice."
"In the last 3 months, as gas prices soared, Exxon Mobil doubled its profit to $5.5 billion. Instead of increasing supply or expanding production, what did Exxon do? Triple its stock buyback program to $30 billion to enrich its wealthy shareholders. We need a windfall profits tax."
"On this Yom HaShoah, we remember the 6 million Jews who were murdered by the Nazis in the Holocaust. At a time of rising antisemitism, racism, and xenophobia, we must honor them today and every day by standing together against all forms of hate, bigotry, and intolerance."
"Mr. Romney supports ""bribes"" in the form of tax cuts for the wealthy and billions in welfare for corporations, but is shocked by the idea that working Americans might get help paying off student debt. I know he thinks corporations are people, but does he know people are people?"
"The time for talk is over. The time for action is now. Taxpayer dollars should not go to companies like Amazon and multi-billionaires like Jeff Bezos, who repeatedly break the law."
The U.S. Department of Labor has the authority to prevent companies like Amazon that have violated labor laws from receiving federal contracts. Taxpayer dollars should not go to companies and multi-billionaires like Jeff Bezos who repeatedly break the law. Let's get this done.

"The federal government bailed out the banks. Trump and the Republicans gave huge tax cuts to the wealthy. Congress is about to hand $10 billion to Jeff Bezos to go the moon. Yes, we can afford to cancel all student debt."
"Since March of 2020 Mr. Bezos became $65 billion richer.

He has enough money to own a $500 million, 417-foot mega-yacht. 

He has enough money to buy a rocket ship to blast William Shatner to outer space. 

Yes, he can provide decent working conditions."
Taxpayer dollars should not go to companies like Amazon and multi-billionaires like Jeff Bezos who repeatedly break the law to defeat union organizing efforts. I'm LIVE on the floor of the Senate to say to President Biden it is time for action.

"If 700 U.S. billionaires could become nearly $2 trillion richer during the pandemic and Trump could provide over $1 trillion in tax breaks to the top 1% and profitable corporations, please don't tell me we can't cancel all $1.8 trillion in student debt for 45 million Americans."

What recent union victories tell me is that working people all over this country are sick and tired of being exploited by corporations that are making record-breaking profits. Workers are fighting for justice in a way we have not seen in years.
LIVE: The American people have had enough! The Budget Committee is holding a hearing now on the unprecedented level of corporate greed that is taking place around us.
"The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which over the last two decades spent nearly $1.4 billion on lobbying to stop legislation that meets the needs of the working class, is VERY NERVOUS that the American people are waking up to the reality of corporate greed and growing inequality."
"Enough is enough. The American people are sick of large corporations making record profits as millions are living paycheck to paycheck. 

Join me TODAY at 11 a.m. ET for a hearing in the Budget Committee to discuss how corporate greed and profiteering are fueling inflation."
"Sadly, my Republican colleagues seem to believe our battle against Covid-19 stops at our border. I regret to inform them that‚Äôs not how pandemics work. If we want to stop the coronavirus, we must fight it all over the world."
LIVE: The recent union victories by @SBWorkersUnited and @amazonlabor tell me that working people all over this country are sick and tired of being exploited by corporations making record-breaking profits. They're prepared to fight for justice and dignity.
"LIVE: If you think that the recent union victories at Amazon and Starbucks are an aberration, you would be sorely mistaken. I‚Äôm on the Senate floor to talk about how workers are standing together and fighting back all over the country."
"Today at 4pm ET, I‚Äôll give remarks on the floor of the U.S. Senate congratulating @amazonlabor and @SBWorkers for their recent victories, and discuss the growing trade union movement in this country."
"Since her nomination by the President, and throughout the hearings, Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson has handled herself with dignity and intelligence ‚Äì more than can be said of her critics.I‚Äôll be voting for her and I‚Äôm confident she'll be an outstanding Supreme Court Justice."
Marijuana should be legal nationwide. All marijuana convictions must be expunged. It is absurd that the federal government considers marijuana to be as dangerous as heroin.
"The American people are sick and tired of our government working for the billionaires and big money interests. 

Maybe, just maybe, we might want to be working for working class Americans."
"The organizing victory at Amazon on Staten Island is a signal that American workers will no longer accept exploitation. They're tired of working longer hours for lower wages. They want an economy that works for all, not just Jeff Bezos. Congratulations to @amazonlabor."
"According to a new Gallup poll, 112 million (44%) Americans are struggling to pay for healthcare, and more than double that number (93%) feel that what they do pay is not worth the cost. Yes. It's time for a health care new system. It's time for Medicare for All."
Anybody who thinks we do not have an oligarchy right here in America is sorely mistaken. The question before us is whether we will stand with the billionaires and big money interests or will we stand with the working families of this country and protect their interests.
LIVE: The Senate Budget Committee is holding a hearing to discuss how President Biden's budget proposal responds to the major crises facing our nation.
"Now that the President has submitted his budget plan, it is up to Congress to review it, pass the proposals that make sense and improve upon it."
"Nurses are the backbone of our health care system.Yet, today, nurses are overworked and underpaid ‚Äì and there aren't enough of them.I am working on legislation to address this crisis."
When we talk about oligarchy in America we are talking about 700 billionaires who became nearly $2 trillion richer during the pandemic &amp; pay a lower tax rate than a nurse while the child poverty rate soared by 41% in January because the expanded Child Tax Credit ended.
"Residents should not have to work 80 hours each week in a hospital.It was an honor to meet with residents at UVM Medical Center who are organizing a union in order to provide not only decent wages and working conditions, but to improve care for their patients."
"The American people are sick and tired of being ripped-off by corporations making record profits, while working families pay absurd prices for gas, rent and food. The time has come for Congress to work for working families and demand that big corporations pay their fair share."
"It makes zero sense to provide $53 billion in corporate welfare to the microchip industry and give $10 billion to Jeff Bezos so he can go to the moon. 

I know it is a radical concept, but maybe the government might want to work for working class Americans, not the billionaires."
"It is imperative that Senators be allowed to vote on whether we should give Jeff Bezos a $10 billion handout to go to the moon and give, with no strings attached, $53 billion to massively profitable microchip companies. I'm going to do all I can to make sure those votes happen."
"Micro-chip companies shut down their plants in the United States and hired cheap labor abroad. Now, the same companies who sold out the American worker, are in line to get $53 billion in corporate welfare. Does that make any sense to you?"
We have never seen this level of corporate greed in America. Let‚Äôs go through a few examples.
"At a time of unprecedented greed, the Senate is right now debating giving $53 billion to the highly profitable micro-chip industry and a $10 billion bailout to Jeff Bezos so that he can launch a rocket ship to the moon. I'm LIVE on the floor to oppose it."
"I say to Howard Schultz: This is a pivotal moment for Starbucks. As you return to the company, it is time to do the right thing: End the union busting and obey the law."
I‚Äôll be LIVE on the floor of the Senate floor today at 2:30pm ET to oppose a bill that hands $53 billion to profitable microchip companies. The people of this country are sick and tired of corporate greed. We must stand with them.
"Why does Putin fear Alexei Navalny? Because Navalny exposed Putin‚Äôs enormous corruption, and the unimaginable wealth Putin has stolen from the Russian people. That‚Äôs why Putin is trying to discredit and silence him. Release Navalny now!"
"Corporate greed is Amazon increasing its profits by 75% last year to a record $35 billion, denying workers a $3 raise, illegally underpaying drivers and blaming a $20 price hike in a Prime membership on ""inflation"" while Jeff Bezos became $81 billion richer during the pandemic."
"In the midst of the current set of horrors ‚Äì war, oligarchy, pandemics, inflation, climate change, etc. ‚Äì we must continue the fight to establish health care as a human right, not a privilege.I will soon be reintroducing our Medicare for All legislation."
"2021 Profits:

Don't cite inflation. Cite corporate greed."
Corporate greed is Moderna giving its CEO a $923 million golden parachute &amp; handing out $360 million in stock options to 2 top executives after receiving $2.5 billion from U.S. taxpayers to develop its COVID vaccine &amp; refusing to share it with the world. We must end this greed.
"Here is the untold story of the global economy. Oligarchy reigns and is getting worse.Today, the 10 richest people own more wealth than the bottom 3.1 billion.We need progressive global taxation and an economy that works for all, not a tiny handful of multi-billionaires."
"LIVE: I‚Äôm joining two strong progressive voices, @DavidLammy and @delarabur, to discuss the international progressive response to Russia‚Äôs war on Ukraine."
"Wendy's increased its net income by 70%, pays its CEO 532X more than its median worker &amp; is spending $100 million on stock buybacks. Now it's blaming the rising price of a Frosty on inflation? No. The problem isn't the Wendy's worker who got a 50 cent raise. It's corporate greed."
"Big oil companies are engaged in massive profiteering and price gouging. We need a windfall profits tax.
 
March 2008
Gas: $3.23 per gallon
Oil: $104.54 per barrel
 
March 2014
Gas: $3.51
Oil: $102.28
 
Last week:
Gas: $4.10
Oil: $111.42

Oil: $95.17"
"If Jeff Bezos can afford a $500 million yacht, a $23 million mansion with 25 bathrooms and a rocket ship to blast a comedian to outer space, you know what? Amazon can afford to give its employees a $3 raise. I stand in strong solidarity with the Amazon workers walkout."
"The war in Ukraine is an absolute disaster for the people of Ukraine and the entire world. But with or without a war, we cannot lose focus on the crises facing working families in the U.S. today. Congress can and must walk and chew bubble gum at the same time."
Why is the price of oil LOWER today than it was in 2014 while the average price for a gallon of gas nationwide is 80 cents a gallon HIGHER than it was eight years ago? Answer: Corporate greed. Now is no time for profiteering. Now is the time for a windfall profits tax.
We must achieve economic justice in this country ‚Äî that means equal pay for equal work NOW.
"Marina Ovsyannikova, an editor at a TV channel in Russia, interrupted a live broadcast with a sign that read ‚ÄúNO WAR. Stop the war. Don't believe the propaganda. They're lying to you here.‚Äù She has since been detained. This is an act of incredible courage."
"If we can spend $782 billion on the military industrial complex and handout $52 billion in corporate welfare to the profitable micro-chip industry, please do not tell me we cannot afford Medicare for All during a pandemic or the Green New Deal during a climate emergency."
"Barack Obama was right. A gas tax holiday was a bad idea in 2008 and it's a bad idea today. If we're serious about providing consumers relief at the gas pump, let's take on the greed of big oil by enacting a windfall profits tax and ending OPEC's illegal price-fixing cartel."
If there's a lesson that should be learned now it is that moving quickly to renewable energy is not just an environmental issue.  It is a matter of national security. We must deny Putin and other petro-dictators the ability to hold the global economy hostage. The time is now!
I‚Äôm delighted to see an agreement reached so that the MLB season can start. But we must prevent the greed of baseball‚Äôs oligarchs from destroying the game. The best way to do that is to end MLB‚Äôs antitrust exemption and I will be introducing legislation to do just that.
"Last year, oil &amp; gas companies made $174 billion in profits. This year they're on track to make more. We cannot allow big oil to use Ukraine &amp; ""inflation"" as an excuse to rip-off Americans. I'm proud to join @SenWhitehouse to introduce a windfall profits tax. Let's get it done."
"This is oligarchy. This is greed. This is callousness. Last year, over 2 million people worldwide died of hunger. At the same time, the world‚Äôs 2,755 billionaires saw their wealth go up by $5 trillion ‚Äì from $8.6 trillion to $13.8 trillion. This is why we need a tax on wealth."
"If there's one thing to learn from this horrible crisis it's this: We must end our dependence on big oil &amp; authoritarian regimes for expensive fossil fuels that are destroying the planet &amp; harming our economy. Now, more than ever, we need a Manhattan Project for renewable energy."
"Today the Senate passed the Postal Service Reform Act. Is this all that is needed to fix the problems of the Postal Service? No, it is not. But it's an important step forward for one of our nation‚Äôs most important government agencies, for its workers, and for our communities."
"Oil company revenues since last year:

Exxon: ‚¨ÜÔ∏è 57%

Chevron: ‚¨ÜÔ∏è 84%

Shell: ‚¨ÜÔ∏è 49%

BP: ‚¨ÜÔ∏è 45%

We cannot allow big oil companies to continue to take advantage of the war in Ukraine &amp; inflation to make huge profits by jacking up gas prices. We need a windfall profits tax."
"Super-large yachts have become the status symbol of the billionaire class. And Russian oligarchs are not the only people who own them. While half of our people work paycheck to paycheck, members of the American oligarchy spend hundreds of millions to build their very own yachts."
"Oligarchy and massive wealth inequality exists not just in Russia. It's worldwide. Since the pandemic, while the wealth of the world's 10 richest people DOUBLED, the income of 99% of the world‚Äôs population declined. The result: More yachts for the rich. More hunger for the poor."
"The GOP claims to be the party of the working class. Yet, the head of the GOP campaign arm released a plan to raise taxes on half of Americans while imposing massive cuts to Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid and education. Oh, yeah. They sure LOVE working people. No doubt."
This is what Oligarchy and Authoritarianism is all about. Putin is not only destroying Ukraine and the Russian economy. He is now in the process of ending the last vestiges of Russian democracy and free speech.
"Unfortunately, we have a corrupt political system and some Senators are more interested in getting campaign contributions from the wealthy and the powerful than doing the work of the American people. It‚Äôs a sad state of affairs."
"We talk about being a divided nation. In many ways, that‚Äôs true. But, in some ways, we are absolutely united. For example, we all hate the drug companies."
Apply for summer internships in my Vermont and Washington D.C. offices. The deadline to apply is March 11. See here for more information:
Putin and his oligarch friends have stolen from the Russian people. They have it all while ordinary people are suffering. I have so much respect for the incredibly brave people in Russia who are out on the streets protesting against what their president is doing.
"Starbucks could give every one of its 383,000 workers a $5,000 bonus &amp; still keep $2.6 billion in profits from last year. Instead they're raising prices while spending $20 billion on stock buybacks &amp; dividends when profits are up 31%. Don't blame inflation. Blame corporate greed."
Abortion is a constitutional right.
Corporate greed is Amazon blaming a 17% increase in its prime membership fees on labor costs while its profits soared 56% last year to $33 billion &amp; Jeff Bezos became $74 billion richer during the pandemic. The problem is not the Amazon worker making $15 an hour. It's greed.
"We can no longer allow big oil companies, huge corporations and the billionaire class to use the murderous Russian invasion of Ukraine and the ongoing pandemic as an excuse to price gouge consumers. It is time to enact a windfall profits tax and reasonable price controls."
"This Russian father is right. Putin and his oligarchs started this horrific war but, as is always the case, it's not their kids who will fight it."
"We need a new member of the Supreme Court who has a strong track record standing up for justice ‚Äì economic justice, racial justice, social justice, political justice and environmental justice. There is no doubt that Judge Jackson is that person. I strongly support her nomination."
"Putin and his oligarch friends seek a divided world and the destruction of democracy. We must stand with the Ukrainian people against this war, and with the Russian people who are demonstrating against their corrupt, reckless president who started it."
"In an authoritarian country like Russia, protest is an act of enormous courage. I stand with the Ukrainian people against this war, and with the Russian people demonstrating against their corrupt, reckless president who started it."
"The U.S. and our allies must impose severe sanctions on Vladimir Putin and his fellow oligarchs. At a time when thousands may die as a result of his war, Putin, one of the richest people in the world, should not be allowed to enjoy the billions he stole from the Russian people."
"It is outrageous, if unsurprising, that Trump would praise Putin‚Äôs murderous invasion of Ukraine as an act of ‚Äúgenius.‚Äù It should concern us all that Putin is exactly the kind of leader Trump would like to be, and that so few Republicans have the courage to say this out loud."
"Corporate greed is Tyson Foods raising the price of beef by 35% while its owner became $1.6 billion richer during the pandemic, its profits skyrocketed by 140% last quarter to $1.12 billion and its CEO got a 22% raise last year to $14 million. It‚Äôs not inflation. It's greed."
Future generations will ask us what we did to stop the climate crisis. What will we tell them?
"Vladimir Putin‚Äôs latest invasion of Ukraine is an indefensible violation of international law, regardless of whatever false pretext he offers. There has always been a diplomatic solution to this situation. Tragically, Putin appears intent on rejecting it."
"Yes, it's important that McDonald's pigs be treated humanely. But maybe it's more important that we take care of the humans who work there by paying them a living wage and making it easier to form a union, instead of spending $15 billion on stock buybacks to enrich the wealthy."
"I know it is a radical idea, but maybe we should do what the American people want, and not what wealthy campaign contributors want."
"Today in America:
- the two richest people own more wealth than the bottom 40%
- the top 1% owns more wealth than the bottom 92%

That level of inequality is immoral and unsustainable."
"If we do not have the courage to stand up to the wealthy and powerful, future generations will look back at this Congress and say, ‚ÄúWhere were you?‚Äù"
"In the midst of our cold winters, one of the outdoor pleasures for many Vermonters is ice fishing. Recently, my team went out on the ice to hear from some Vermonters about why they love the sport. I hope you'll enjoy hearing what they had to say."
"It is outrageous that a drug discovered with American taxpayer dollars costs nearly $190,000. This is just one more example of the incredible greed of the pharmaceutical industry. I urge the Administration to use the tools they have to lower the cost of this drug now."
"It is beyond belief that in 2022, as we face challenges like covid &amp; climate change, any national leader would start a war that could kill thousands &amp; create millions of refugees. There is a diplomatic solution to this crisis.It is tragic that Putin seems intent to reject it."
Never before in American history have so few owned so much. Maybe the Senate should consider a resolution congratulating the billionaire class for their enormous success transforming our society.
"In January, the child poverty rate increased by 40% in just 1 month ‚Äì jumping from 12.1% to 17% as 3.7 million children slipped into poverty. How did this happen? 50 Republicans and 1 corporate Democrat allowed the $300 a month Child Tax Credit to expire. That is morally obscene."
"When we talk about power in America, we must talk about the handful of Wall Street firms that wield enormous influence over millions of workers, consumers, and our entire economy ‚Äî from banking and transportation, to newspapers, nursing homes, hospitals, and emergency rooms."
Nearly half of all renters in the U.S. pay more than a third of their income toward rent and utility bills.
LIVE: @SenWarren joins the Senate Budget Committee to testify on the incredible concentration of ownership on Wall Street and what that means for working people.
LIVE: The Senate Budget Committee is holding a hearing on the obscene concentration of ownership on Wall Street and the power that a handful of firms have over our entire economy.
Today at 11am ET we will be holding a hearing in the Senate Budget Committee to discuss an issue that doesn‚Äôt get talked about enough: the incredible concentration of ownership on Wall Street and its negative effect on millions of Americans.
"LIVE: Join me for a town meeting with Vermont middle and high school students. We will hear from student panelists about the issues that matter most to them, the challenges they face, and how we can address the needs of young people."
"We are living at this moment in the most difficult time of our lives. Meanwhile, billionaires have never had it better."
TONIGHT AT 6:30 pm: Tune in to hear Vermont students talk about how we can address the needs of young people across our state and country. The event will be livestreamed right here. Students can register to participate at the link below.
It is not fair and it is not just that the two wealthiest people in America now own more wealth than the bottom 42%. I‚Äôm on the floor of the Senate NOW to demand action on the needs of our working families.
"These are very difficult times for working families. But for billionaires and the CEOs of large corporations, times have never been better. I‚Äôm LIVE on the Senate floor to explain why."
"I‚Äôll be LIVE today on the floor of the U.S. Senate at 1:40pm ET. At a time when the working class is falling further behind and the billionaire class is doing incredibly well, it is time for Congress to stand up for working people."
"Shock. Shock. Shock. Gas prices are at the highest level in 7 years while Exxon Mobil, Chevron, Shell &amp; BP made nearly $25 billion in profits last quarter ‚Äì the highest level in over 7 years. The problem is not inflation. The problem is corporate greed, collusion &amp; profiteering."
We must never succumb to despair or lose hope for a brighter future. We must continue the fight for a more just and decent world.
"True tax rate for the 25 richest people in the United States: 3.4%
Average tax rate for a nurse: 24%

A nurse should not pay more in income tax than a billionaire."
Cancel it. Every penny.
"Vermont middle and high school students: I want to hear from you! Join me this Wednesday, February 16 for a virtual town meeting to discuss the issues that matter most to you. To participate in the discussion, register at the link below."
The billionaire class has seen its wealth explode during the pandemic while half of our people continue to live paycheck to paycheck.
"How does it happen that SoFI, a student loan re-financing company, could spend $625 million to put its name on the LA Rams football stadium when 45 million Americans are drowning in $1.8 trillion in student debt? Today would be a good day for the President to cancel student debt."
"Corporate greed is Kroger giving its CEO a 296% pay raise over the past decade, increasing profits by 23.5% in 2021, seeing its stock price jump 36% in the past year and spending $1.5 billion on stock buybacks and dividends, while 44% of Kroger workers can't afford rent."
"8 of the largest drug companies in the United States made nearly $50 billion in profits in 2020, while the CEOs in those pharma giants made over $350 million in total compensation.

Meanwhile, Americans pay some of the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs."
"Do you know why 1 out of 4 Americans can't afford their prescription drugs?

Do you know why thousands of Americans die every year because they can‚Äôt afford their medicine?

Do you know why millions of Americans ration their insulin?

I'll tell you why: greed, greed, greed."
"Corporate greed is Chipotle increasing its profits by 181% last year to $764 million, giving its CEO a 137% pay raise to $38 million in 2020 and blaming the rising cost of a burrito on a minimum wage worker who got a 50 cent pay raise. That's not inflation. That's price gouging."
18 million families in our country are spending over 50% of their limited incomes on housing. Does that sound to you like an economy that works?
Bringing people together to resolve conflicts without war is not weakness - it is strength.
"If my Republican colleagues are so concerned about inflation maybe, just maybe, they should not have blocked the bill I introduced yesterday with Senator Klobuchar to cut prescription drug prices under Medicare in half by taking on the greed of the pharmaceutical industry."
We must vigorously support diplomatic efforts to deescalate this crisis and reaffirm Ukrainian independence and sovereignty. I‚Äôm LIVE on the Senate floor explaining why.
"Since 2008, 45% of all new income has gone to the top 1%. We have got to demand that the wealthiest people and most profitable corporations in America pay their fair share of taxes."
The American people are being played for suckers. Congress must stand up to the greed of the pharmaceutical industry.
The time for talk is over. The time to act is now. I‚Äôm LIVE on the floor of the U.S. Senate with @SenAmyKlobuchar demanding a debate and a vote to bring down the outrageous price of prescription drugs.
The time is now for Congress to stand up to the pharmaceutical industry which over the last 20 years spent over $4.5 billion on lobbying and hundreds of millions of dollars in campaign contributions. Join us LIVE at 5:30pm ET as we take the fight to the floor of the U.S. Senate.
"Enough is enough! Tonight at 5:30pm ET, I will go to the floor with @SenAmyKlobuchar to DEMAND that the U.S. Senate finally pass legislation to lower the cost of prescription drugs. We must stand up to the greed of the pharmaceutical industry."
"In the richest country in the history of the world, close to 600,000 people are homeless during the dead of winter. To my mind, that is immoral."
We must support Ukraine‚Äôs democracy while working toward a realistic resolution that will prevent a devastating war.
No one should be dying in the United States of America because they cannot afford their prescription drugs. Period.
Congratulations to Ryan Cochran-Siegle of Vermont for winning silver in the super-G for the USA at the Beijing Olympics! Your perseverance is an inspiration to people across Vermont and the nation.
"Corporate greed is Netflix making a record-breaking $5.1 billion profit, giving its CEO $43 million in total compensation, avoiding over $1 billion in taxes and paying a 1.1% effective federal income tax rate ‚Äì a lower tax rate than a nurse, teacher or truck driver. #TaxTheRich"
Insulin in the United States should not cost 10 times what it costs in Canada.
"If you're experiencing mail delays, you're not alone. It‚Äôs time to strengthen the Postal Service, not dismantle it. It‚Äôs time to stand up for the dedicated postal workers clocking 12-hour shifts, seven days a week for their communities."
"Are you prepared to stand up to the pharmaceutical industry?
Are you prepared to stand up to the fossil fuel industry?
Are you prepared to stand up to the ruling class?

If you are prepared to do all of that, then together we can create a nation that is based on justice."
"Life expectancy is in direct correlation to income. If you are poor in this country, you can expect to live 15 years LESS than if you are rich. To my mind, that is ABSURD.
 
We must build a health care system and economy that work for all of us, not just a few."
"To all the Olympians representing Vermont at the 2022 Winter Olympics: Congratulations and good luck! 
 
Representing our state and country in the Olympics is no small accomplishment and is a testament to the hard work and discipline of each of you."
"CEOs now make over 350 times as much as their average employees.

"We must make it easier, not harder, for all workers to form a union. That includes Congressional Staff. I stand in solidarity with Congressional staff working to form a union."
"What do I mean by a rigged economy? In the United States today, 745 billionaires now own more wealth than the bottom 60% of all our people combined.
 
Enough. It's time to put working people first."
"There will be no real social progress in this country unless we have the courage to take on Wall Street, the insurance companies, the drug companies, the fossil fuel industry, and all other forces of greed."

New moms in Canada: guaranteed 119 days of paid leave.
New moms in France: guaranteed 112 days of paid leave.

New moms in the United States: guaranteed ZERO days of paid leave.

We must end this international embarrassment."
"The choice is simple: Will we stand with the working class to guarantee paid family leave, expand Medicare, and address the climate crisis, or will Congress, yet again, do the bidding of powerful special interests? I choose to stand with the working class."
"Call me a radical, but I happen to believe that a job should lift workers out of poverty ‚Äì not keep them in it."
"When you have a proposal that has the overwhelming support of the American people, we can't allow that to die. If some Senators choose to side with corporate America, that's their business. But for me, and I think millions of Americans, it's time to fight for working families."
"The American people are asking: who does Congress represent?
 
84% of the American people support expanding Medicare to include dental, vision, and hearing care. We must deliver."
"In this very difficult moment, when we‚Äôre trying to prevent the destruction of American democracy, when we‚Äôre trying to save the planet, when we‚Äôre trying to protect working families, now is the time, more than ever before, to be clear on what we stand for."
"The American people want the big money industries to start paying their fair share of taxes. They understand that it is absurd that 2 people own more wealth than the bottom 40%, and that the gap between the very rich and everyone else is wider than it has been in 100 years."
There is something profoundly wrong in America when a company like Exelan can raise the price of a generic drug to treat high blood pressure (lisinopril) by 536% to as much as $550. How many more Americans have to die and suffer before Congress has the guts to end this greed?
Interesting article. Is Mr. Cooperman an evil man? No. Has he worked hard for his money? Yes. Can we create a system more rational &amp; humane than one in which a billionaire sits at a computer screen &amp; makes millions while people nearby go hungry? We must.
"64% of the American people support creating good-paying jobs by making investments in clean energy and preparing for extreme weather events.

The question is clear: will we stand with the American people or will Congress protect the interests of the fossil fuel industry?"

"83% of the American peoplesupport empoweringthe federal government to negotiatewith the pharmaceutical industry to lower prescription drug prices.

Let‚Äôs get it done."
The United States is the only major country on Earth not to guarantee paid family and medical leave. 73% of the American people want that to change. What are we waiting for?
"At a time when 71% of the American people support raising income taxes on the top 2 percent and 65% of our people want to increase taxes on large corporations, it is time to take on the greed of the ruling class. Period."
I‚Äôm LIVE now at the Progressive Strategy Summit to discuss the path forward for an agenda that finally meets the needs of the working class.

"America's billionaires got $1 TRILLION richer in 2021. Meanwhile, millions of Americans are struggling to put food on the table.
 
Does that sound to anyone like an economy that works?"
"I‚Äôm glad to hear that the SALT provisions are no longer in play for Build Back Better. Democrats need to focus on the struggling working class, not giving more tax breaks to the wealthy."
I do not think we should allow ourselves to grow comfortable with the fact that the richest two people in this country own more wealth than the bottom 40% of Americans.
Volunteer firefighters and EMTs play an enormously important role in rural America. But many departments are struggling right now to retain staff and attract new recruits. We talked to some Vermonters about how we can begin to address the crisis.
The American people deserve to know which side their elected officials are on. It is time for the Senate to vote on legislation that addresses the needs of working families. We must challenge Republicans to vote against these important and popular initiatives.
Republicans are laughing all the way to Election Day. They have not had to cast one vote against any enormously popular policies. That‚Äôs got to change now.
"Abortion is a constitutional right, period. If men were the ones giving birth, I doubt that this would be in question. We must stand up and defend a woman‚Äôs right to control her own body. We must pass legislation that codifies Roe v. Wade as the law of the land."
"A rigged economic and political system is when billionaires spend $1.2 billion in campaign contributions to buy politicians in the last election, become $2 trillion richer during the pandemic and pay a lower effective tax rate than a nurse. Yes, we must abolish Citizens United."
"Now is the time to rally the American people around an agenda that works for all, not just the 1%."
Now is the time for Senate Democrats to put legislation on the floor that addresses the needs of working families and challenge Republicans to vote against these important and popular initiatives.
"I sent a letter today to the CEO of Kroger with a simple message: the company, which is doing very well, can afford to provide grocery store workers ‚Äì the true heroes and heroines of this pandemic ‚Äì good wages, good benefits, safe working conditions and reliable work schedules."
"If you think the Freedom to Vote Act makes sense, you‚Äôre worried about American democracy, and you‚Äôre prepared to vote for the bill, then why are two Democrats wasting everybody's time and not voting for the rule change to see this through?

That I do not understand."
"As every member of the Senate knows, the rules around here get changed all the time. If we can change the rules to prevent a default on our national debt, if we can change the rules to confirm Supreme Court justices, we can certainly change the rules to save American democracy."
What we are debating today may seem complicated. But it is really quite simple. I‚Äôm LIVE on the floor discussing why now is the time to defend American democracy.
"Not all masks are created equal. N95s are far more effective at preventing the spread of COVID-19. I applaud the Biden Administration for making 400 million N95 masks available for free around the country. It is a good first step, and more must be done."
"Tomorrow, the Senate is going to be casting an enormously important vote about whether we preserve the foundations of democracy. As of now, two Democrats will join the Republicans to vote against us and we will lose that vote. Let me tell you why I hope they change their minds."
"Last year, CEOs of the top 350 firms in the U.S. made, on average, 351 times more than a typical worker. 

To my mind, that is absurd. It is time to end the obscene levels of income inequality in this country."
"You can now get at-home COVID-19 tests delivered to your home for free. 

Go to  to order your free tests now. It takes less than 30 seconds."
"Afghanistan is facing a humanitarian catastrophe. I urge the Biden administration to immediately release billions in frozen Afghan government funds to help avert this crisis, and prevent the death of millions of people."
"Since June of last year, 17 states have enacted 28 new laws that restrict voting access.  

Let's be clear. If we are serious about calling ourselves a democracy, we must make it easier for people to vote ‚Äì not harder."
"As the voting rights bill finally comes to the floor of the Senate, there is only one vote which will really matter. Will 50 Democrats vote to override the filibuster, protect American democracy and pass the bill, or will Manchinand Sinema vote with the GOP and let the bill die?"
"As we celebrate the extraordinary life of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., let us not just celebrate the man, but remember the values and vision that motivated him."
Tax the billionaires. Invest in the working class.
"We must utilize the Defense Production Act to produce and deliver high-quality, N95 masks to every person in this country."
This is what the undermining of American democracy looks like. This is what is taking place all across the country. This is why it is an outrage that two Democratic senators have joined Republicans in refusing to pass the Freedom to Vote bill.
It is a sad day when two members of the Democratic Caucus are prepared to allow the Freedom to Vote Act to fail and undermine the future of American democracy. I hope very much they will reconsider their positions.
We must have the courage to take on the greed of billionaire CEOs and their lobbyists.
"Instead of providing the kind of wages and benefits that the workers need, Warrior Met has made a totally unsatisfactory offer. Mr. Fink must tell the company‚Äôs executives to sit down and negotiate a fair contract now."
"Millions of people are hurting. They are struggling to put food on the table for their kids. Meanwhile, the rich are better off than they have ever been. That is the economic reality facing this country right now."
This is a terrible time. But to throw our hands up in despair is not going to solve the problem. We must work together to get out of the crises we face.
‚ÄúWhich side are you on?‚Äù It is a simple yet profound political question. Is the Democratic Party prepared to stand on the side of struggling working families?
"Maybe, just maybe, when the two wealthiest people in this country own more wealth than the bottom 40%, it‚Äôs time for bold action. It‚Äôs time to end the obscene levels of wealth inequality in this country."
"Jon Donaire Desserts epitomizes the corporate greed that is taking place in this country. I joined @SenAlexPadilla and 5 of our colleagues to stand with striking workers and ask why Bob Rich, who‚Äôs worth more than $7 billion, wants to cut back on the needs of struggling workers."
"Americans should not pay an outrageous price for a drug that their tax dollars helped develop. Today‚Äôs action by CMS, along with Secretary Becerra‚Äôs move to direct Medicare to reconsider a premium rate hike caused in part by the price of Aduhelm, is an important step forward."
All Americans should have face masks that will keep them safe. I will be introducing legislation tomorrow for N95 masks to be sent to every household in the country. This will save lives and reduce health care costs.
"If we are serious about calling ourselves a democracy, we must act NOW. We must end the filibuster in the Senate. We must end the voter suppression and extreme gerrymandering sweeping the country. Our democracy depends on it."
"We must make it clear to working people that we are prepared to take on the greed of the ruling class, that we have the courage to stand up and fight for their interests."
"I've got a message for all the billionaire CEOs out there:
 
If you love America, then you love the workers of this country. And if you love American workers, you pay them a fair wage with decent benefits. You treat them with the dignity that they deserve. Period."
"In the midst of a horrific pandemic, two-thirds of low-wage workers still lack access to paid sick leave. That is barbaric.
 
We must guarantee that all workers have a right to paid sick leave."
"Today, the top 1% own more wealth than the bottom 92%. That is absurd.
 
We must take on the billionaires and fight for the needs of the working class."
"While the owners of Walmart, the wealthiest family in the country, became over $60 billion richer during the pandemic, they are now slashing the paid leave of their employees in half.Outrageous. We must end corporate greed and raise the minimum wage to at least $15 an hour."
One of the great crises facing our democracy is the power of the billionaire class over our political process. The needs of ordinary people are ignored as the rich and their Super PACs buy elections.
Billionaires in the United States should not be paying less in taxes than teachers and nurses.
"It is time we become a nation that is based on the principles of justice and compassion, not greed and oligarchy."
"One year ago, a violent mob stormed the Capitol to overturn the 2020 election. That day made clear our democracy is under severe attack. We must hold responsible those who engaged in the insurrection. We must stand up to the Big Lie. We must make it easier, not harder, to vote."
This pandemic isn't over. We need to protect the workers fighting on the frontlines. I stand in solidarity with nurses and health care workers demanding that the Department of Labor retain emergency workplace protections and quickly issue a permanent standard.
"At a time when the demagogues want to divide us up, we must do exactly the opposite. We must bring people together. We must educate, organize and build an unstoppable grassroots movement that helps create the kind of nation we know we can become."
"The greatest weapon our opponents have is not just their unlimited wealth and power. It is their ability to create a culture that makes us feel weak and hopeless and diminishes the strength of human solidarity.
 
We cannot let them succeed."
"Here is our new year‚Äôs resolution. Like the thousands of workers who stood up and fought courageously in 2021, we will do the same. No one individual is going to save us. We must rise up together."
"Maybe, just maybe, in the richest country in the history of the world people should be able to afford the drugs prescribed by their doctor."
"Call me radical, but I happen to believe that no one should have to work more than 1 job to live with dignity."
"Trump wants to do here what Orban has done in Hungary: weaken democratic institutions, curb press freedom, and rewrite election laws to entrench his own party‚Äôs power. The threat to our democracy could not be clearer, and we must act boldly to protect it."
"Some people ask, ‚ÄúWell, Bernie, how can we afford to act on climate change?‚Äù The real question is: how can we afford NOT to act while climate change causes so much destruction and suffering?"
21 states and 35 cities and counties raised their minimum wage today. The overwhelming majority of the American people understand that we must end starvation wages in America. Congress must act and raise the federal minimum wage from $7.25 an hour to $15 an hour.
Jane and I want to take this opportunity to wish you and yours a safe and healthy new year. 2022 is not a time for despair or cynicism. Now is a time for hard work. Now is a time to stand up and fight for the country that we know we can become.
"Unless we act boldly and quickly to take on the existential threat of climate change, we will see irreparable harm done to this planet."
"When you have an extremely profitable, well-financed corporation owned by one of the wealthiest guys in the world, you know what? You should not be demanding wage cuts from your workers and cuts in their health care benefits. That‚Äôs just wrong."
"This pandemic has shown us clearly the vulgarity of our healthcare ""system."" Highest costs in the world, yet not enough nurses or doctors. Many millions uninsured, while insurance company profits soar.The struggle continues. Healthcare is a human right. Medicare for all."
"Harry Reid was an outstanding leader and a friend. I have fond memories of working with him on important issues impacting working families, including the vast expansion of community health centers. Jane and I will miss him and send our condolences to Landra and the entire family."
"During this horrific pandemic, which has taken over 800,000 American lives, corporate profits are soaring, and the billionaire class has become much wealthier. In fact, income and wealth inequality today is higher than at any time in the last 100 years."
"The expansion of the child tax credit this year has reduced child poverty in America by 40%.Incredible! But, if Build Back Better is not passed, that provision will soon expire and millions of children will be plunged back into poverty. Pathetic!"
"This pandemic makes it clear how dysfunctional our healthcare system is. Not only do we pay the highest prices in the world, we can‚Äôt even produce the number of doctors and nurses that we desperately need. Let us not give up the struggle for Medicare for All."
"As we face the rapidly spreading omicron variant, we should remember that not all face masks are created equal. Congress must demand the mass production and distribution of N-95 masks, the most effective way to stop the spread of the Covid virus."
"Archbishop Tutu helped end apartheid in South Africa by reminding us, ‚Äúif you are neutral in situations of injustice, you have chosen the side of the oppressor.‚Äù We remember this hero as we continue the work for equality and justice."
"Jane and I wish you and yours a very safe and merry Christmas. I am absolutely confident that, as we stand together, we will defeat this pandemic and move our country and world forward toward peace, justice and environmental sanity. Keep the faith."
It‚Äôs time for the American people to understand which side their senators are on.‚ÄØNo more excuses.‚ÄØNo more delays. It‚Äôs time for the U.S. Senate to vote.
I wrote a letter today with @SenatorLeahy and Rep. @PeterWelch to Postmaster DeJoy about the Postal Service‚Äôs continued failure to meet its own standards of service in VT. Postal employees are working remarkably hard and DeJoy must provide them with the equipment they need.
"Given the serious crisis and total failure of leadership at the United States Postal Service, I am urging President Biden to demand the immediate resignation of Louis DeJoy as Postmaster General."
When I was in high school and college I ran the mile and cross-country and loved track and field. So it has been a lot of fun for me personally to watch Elle's incredible achievements and to cheer her on. Like many other Vermonters I look forward to seeing what Elle does next.
"Did you know Vermont is home to one of the most outstanding athletes in the country? Meet Elle Purrier St. Pierre, born and raised in Vermont, an Olympian, the holder of the U.S. women's one-mile and two-mile record, and a proud Vermont dairy farmer."
Does Congress have the guts to take on the drug companies who are spending over $300 million in lobbying? Do we have the guts to take on the insurance companies who don't want us to expand Medicare? Do we have the guts to take on the fossil fuel industry to save the planet?
Everybody in America must understand that the scientists are telling us we have very little time to transform our energy system away from fossil fuels to prevent future disasters. The time to address the climate crisis is NOW.
The time is now for the Democratic Party to restore faith with the American people and show them that we are prepared to take on the powerful to address the long neglected needs of the working class.
"We cannot keep talking and talking. It's time for Senate Democrats to bring a strong, comprehensive bill to the floor for a vote."
"Millions of people around the world are already experiencing the devastating effects of climate change.

The price of waiting until it is too late to address the climate crisis is far greater than the cost of coming together to combat climate change NOW. We must act."
Sen. Joe Manchin should explain to the people of West Virginia why he doesn‚Äôt have the courage to stand up to special interests.
"If Sen. Manchin wants to vote against the Build Back Better Act, he should have the opportunity to do so with a floor vote as soon as the Senate returns."
"We will all be safer when we are all vaccinated. But right now, fewer than 3% of people in low-income countries have been vaccinated. We must take on the greed of the pharmaceutical industry and grant a temporary patent waiver to unlock vaccine production in developing countries."
"All across the country workers are standing up and saying, ‚Äúwe want dignity, we want respect, we want justice.‚Äù Let‚Äôs stand with them."
"You can disagree. You can fight for your ideas. But when we have zero support from Republicans, two Democrats cannot torpedo a bill supported overwhelmingly by the American people. I do not respect that kind of arrogance."
"The workers‚Äô struggle against Kellogg‚Äôs is a lot more than just 1,400 employees on strike in Michigan, Pennsylvania, Tennessee and Nebraska.  

It‚Äôs about what this country and our economy is supposed to stand for. I‚Äôm proud to stand with the workers."
"I stand in solidarity with the @TPINUnion workers who are organizing to form a union. 

TPIN must respect the constitutional right of its employees to form a union and should immediately recognize the union."
"When future generations ask us what we did to stop the climate crisis, how will we answer?"
I hope that very soon the Senate will take two giant leaps forward for the American people: protect the voting rights of every American and pass the most consequential legislation to benefit working families in the modern history of our country.
"In my view, an asthma inhaler that is sold to the Canadian people for just $27 should not cost the American people $242. Period."
Today we remember the unspeakable tragedy that stole the lives of 20 children and 6 educators at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut. We cannot continue to allow sickening and senseless gun violence in this country. The time for Congress to act is long overdue.
"We need leadership at the FDA that is finally willing to stand up to the greed and power of the pharmaceutical industry. In this critical moment, Dr. Califf is not the leader Americans need at the agency and I will oppose his nomination."
"At a time when one out of four Americans cannot afford their prescription drugs, maybe, just maybe, it‚Äôs time we take on the greed of the pharmaceutical industry."
The question is simple: Does Congress have the guts and courage to finally take on the greed of the billionaires and large corporations?
"Today, our younger generations have a lower standard of living than their parents did at their age. 

Meanwhile, the cost of housing is 72% higher and the cost of college is 163% higher than it was 20 years ago ‚Äì after adjusting for inflation.

The time for action is NOW."
President Biden is exactly right. I stand in strong solidarity with the workers who are taking on Kellogg‚Äôs greed.
"While the majority of the American people have expressed overwhelming support for the Build Back Better Act and delivering for working Americans, Republicans continue to oppose it.

Maybe, just maybe, that‚Äôs why they have to resort to voter suppression."
"No, we should not accept a health care system that allows the pharmaceutical industry to raise the cost of prescription drugs whenever they want to whatever they want. That is barbaric."
"When a small number of people at the top are doing phenomenally well, while millions of people struggle, maybe, just maybe, it‚Äôs time we stand up for the working class of this country."
Every worker should have the constitutional right to join a union. Period.
"My simple question is, why in the world would the United States reward a regime that has caused such pain in Yemen with more weapons. The answer is we should not."
LIVE: The Saudi government is waging a devastating war in Yemen and repressing its own people. We should not be rewarding them with more weapons of war. I‚Äôm on the floor of the Senate NOW to block an arms sale to this regime.
"If the founder of Starbucks can become nearly $2 BILLION richer during the pandemic, yes, Starbucks can afford to pay its workers a living wage."
"In the richest country in the history of the world, mothers should have a right to spend time with their newborns. We must enact paid family and medical leave NOW."
Why should we accept a reality in which the rich have so much while so many have so little?
"Rep. @IlhanMNis a leader of incredible courage. Sadly, these bigoted attacks are not the first she‚Äôs endured in her life. The vicious hatred directed toward her has no place anywhere, especially not in Congress. I urge the House Democratic leadership to take immediate action."
"Medicare must not significantly raise premiums in order to pay $56,000 a year for a drug of questionable value. This is precisely why Medicare should be negotiating prices with the pharmaceutical industry."
"This is obscene. Last week, 8 investors in Pfizer and Moderna became $10 billion richer as news about the Omicron variant spread. It's time for these pharmaceutical companies to share their vaccines with the world and start controlling their greed. Enough is enough!"
"Americans are entitled to an efficient, well-run postal service with high-quality mail delivery standards.That is why Postmaster General DeJoy should be removed from office."
"Bob Dole served his country with courage on the battlefield, and with dignity in the Senate. Jane and I send our condolences to his family."
"Is anyone in the United States Congress willing to tell me with a straight face that ‚Äúyeah, the American people enjoy paying some of the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs?‚Äù Totally absurd."
We must stand up to the drug companies and stop this massive hike in Medicare premiums.
"No. We cannot allow Medicare to increase premiums on 57 million senior citizens because Biogen wants to charge $56,000 for an Alzheimer's drug that independent experts say should cost between $3,000-$8,400."
"What @RepRoKhanna and I are saying is simple: The U.S. must stop enabling the disastrous Saudi-led war in Yemen. The war has gone on far too long, and it‚Äôs time we begin to take bold steps on the path to peace."
"We must build an economy that works for all Americans, not just billionaires and large corporations. Period."
"The bottom line is you can‚Äôt talk about demanding the wealthy pay their fair share of taxes, and then give large tax breaks to millionaires. It‚Äôs just too much hypocrisy."
"Our government must work for ordinary Americans, not the top 1%. That should not be a radical idea."
"We have all the tools we need to end AIDS deaths and HIV transmissions. We just need the political will. We must do all we can, together, to rid the world of this terrible disease. #WorldAIDSDay"
"In the richest country in the history of the world, keeping teeth in your mouth as you grow old should not be a luxury. We must expand Medicare NOW."
"You‚Äôre going to be hearing a lot about abortion in the news today. To my mind, this is not a complicated issue. Here‚Äôs why."
"As the Supreme Court today hears a case on Roe v. Wade, let me be very clear. It is a woman who has the right to control her own body, not the government. If men were the ones giving birth, I doubt that this would be in question."
Politicians who gerrymander districts to unfairly gain political advantages are undermining our democracy. Period.
It is long due time we rebuild the trade union movement in this country.
"119. That‚Äôs how many days of paid leave new moms are guaranteed in Canada.

Do you know how many days of paid leave they‚Äôre guaranteed in the United States? Z-E-R-O. What a disgrace."
"Let's be clear. The problem is not the worker who got a small raise &amp; a $1,400 check 7 months ago. The problem is corporations making record-breaking profits while 700 billionaires became $2 trillion richer during the pandemic. We need an economy that works for all, not the 1%."
"The time for debate by the members of the World Trade Organization is over. We must urgently move NOW to dismantle the vaccine inequality that undermines our ability to confront this crisis and make vaccine technologies available to all, regardless of wealth."
"I have the radical idea that Congress should do what the American people want. And what they want is to have Medicare cover not only hearing, but dental and vision as well. I intend to do everything I can to make that happen."
One of the greatest political crises we face is voter suppression. Our job: fight back. Defend voting rights. Create a vibrant democracy.
"What if instead of helping billionaires fund their space hobby, we invested in working people here on Earth?"
"Democracy means one person, one vote. It does not mean outrageous gerrymandering maps and absurd laws to suppress to vote."
"It is expensive to raise kids, and working class parents are struggling.By expanding the Child Tax Credit we have helped millions of families and are cutting childhood poverty by 45%. A great accomplishment. Yet,not one Republicanwill vote to extend that program. Pathetic."
President Biden is right. The time is now to waive IP protections to enable vaccine technologies to be shared as widely as possible.
"The Republican idea of democracy is voter suppression, extreme gerrymandering, and billionaires buying elections."
"While working people struggle with high gas prices at the pump, Exxon made $6.8 billion in profits in the last quarter and Chevron made $6.1 billion.We must stop the profiteering and monopolistic behavior of the giant oil companies.American consumers deserve better."
The American people want fair elections. They do not want extreme gerrymandering. They do not want voter suppression. Period.
"Jane and I want to take this opportunity to wish everyone a very Happy Thanksgiving. In these difficult times let us continue standing together, with hope and love, to create the world of peace and justice that we all deserve. Despair is not an option."
We have very little time to save American democracy from Republican voter suppression and extreme gerrymandering. EVERY Democrat must support ending the filibuster in order to pass the voting rights act.
"It's absolutely unacceptable that Louis DeJoy, a top campaign contributor of Donald Trump, is still the Postmaster General. He should have been fired a long time ago. We need new leadership who will fight to strengthen and expand the Postal Service, not undermine and sabotage it."
Here‚Äôs a radical idea: billionaires should pay their fair share.
The American people want to see Congress finally stand up for working families. That‚Äôs exactly what we must do.
"When 1 in 4 Americans can‚Äôt afford their prescription drugs, maybe, just maybe, we should take on the greed of the pharmaceutical industry."
Am I supposed to be impressed that billionaires are going to space while they‚Äôve paid zero in federal income taxes some years? Nope. It‚Äôs time to invest in working people here on Earth.
Insulin should not cost 10 times as much in the United States as it does in Canada. Period.
"Working people are struggling.

Their jobs don‚Äôt pay enough. 
They have too much debt.
They can‚Äôt afford their prescription drugs.
The planet around them is becoming uninhabitable. 

Now is the time for the United States government to finally address their needs."
"There is more wealth inequality today than at any point in the last 100 years. 

It‚Äôs time billionaires pay their fair share."
"My colleagues seem to be so concerned with the deficit when it comes to addressing the needs of working people, but all of a sudden forget about the deficit when we're talking about an annual defense budget of $778 BILLION. What hypocrisy."
Let me be clear: the rich do not need more tax breaks.
Moral policy is good politics. Period.
"If we mobilize, if we come together, if we have a vision ‚Äì based on justice ‚Äì of where we want our country to go, we can win. We can create the world that we know we can become."
"Right now, the people on top are doing phenomenally well while the working class of this country continues to struggle. That is not right. That MUST change."
"As the Saudi government continues to wage its devastating war in Yemen and repress its own people, we should not be rewarding them with more arms sales."
"When it comes to improving the lives of our people, I hear, ‚ÄúOh my god, Bernie! The deficit! The national debt!‚Äù

When it comes to military spending, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs ok, not a problem.‚Äù

The hypocrisy is extraordinary."
I applaud Democrats in the House of Representatives for uniting to pass the Build Back Better Act. The Senate has an opportunity to make this a truly historic piece of legislation. We will listen to the demands of the American people and strengthen the bill.
"What if ‚Äî and stick with me for a minute, because this is a pretty far out concept to some of my Republican colleagues in Washington ‚Äì what if we spent as much money helping the working class of this country as we do on our nation‚Äôs military?"
Now is the time to reassess our national priorities. Now is the time to fight for real change.
"In the last 12 months, over 100,000 Americans died from drug overdose. That‚Äôs the most ever recorded in a single year and a 30% increase over last year. We are now living through a nationwide crisis of deaths of despair. Our people are in need, and their government must respond."
"How is it that there is always money for war but never enough money for the children, the sick, the hungry, and the poor?"
"Let me say it again. You can‚Äôt be a political party that talks about demanding the wealthy pay their fair share of taxes, and then end up with a bill that gives large tax breaks to millionaires. You can‚Äôt do that. The hypocrisy is too strong. It‚Äôs bad policy, it‚Äôs bad politics."
"When it comes to the needs of the military industrial complex: No problem!

When it comes to the needs of working people: Too expensive. 

I'm tired of it. We need to get our priorities right."
I‚Äôm voting NO on the $778 billion defense spending bill. I‚Äôm LIVE now on the floor of the Senate explaining why.
"As a nation, we need to get our priorities right. I wanted to take a minute to tell you why I‚Äôm voting against the defense spending bill."
No. Congress should not provide a $10 billion handout to Jeff Bezos for space exploration as part of the defense spending bill. Unbelievable.
"Many of my colleagues, day after day, talk about how deeply concerned they are about the deficit and the national debt. They tell us that we just don‚Äôt have enough money to expand Medicare, to guarantee paid family and medical leave, and to address the climate crisis."
The most radical thing we can do when it comes to climate change is nothing. We MUST act.
"The fact of the matter is there are more working class people than there are billionaires. Let‚Äôs stand up, fight back, and create the kind of nation we know we deserve."
"In the richest country in the history of the world, 1 in 4 Americans are unable to afford their prescription drugs. That is ABSURD."
"Does it make sense to anyone that the United States is the only major country on Earth not to guarantee paid family and medical leave? 

It‚Äôs time to end that international embarrassment."
"If you haven't filed your taxes, TODAY is the LAST DAY in 2021 to sign up for the Child Tax Credit. The CTC has lifted more than 3 MILLION kids out of poverty this year alone. Join the millions of working families helping to cut childhood poverty in half."
"I know I speak for all Vermonters in expressing the deep gratitude we feel for the extraordinary role that Sen. Leahy has played in representing Vermont in the U.S. Senate for the last 46 years.
 
Jane and I wish him and Marcelle a wonderful and well-earned retirement."
"How absurd is it that the Republicans who tell us over and over how much they care about ‚Äúfreedom‚Äù are also defending book burning, homophobia and racism. That is not what ""freedom"" is about.That's authoritarianism and bigotry."
"While we pay the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs and 1 out of 4 Americans can‚Äôt afford the medicine they need, the top 15 pharmaceutical executives pulled in more than $470 million in salaries and bonuses last year.Greed.Greed. Greed."
We must demand that the extremely wealthy pay their fair share. Period.
I am deeply concerned by the worsening humanitarian crisis in Ethiopia‚Äôs Tigray region. The United States must work together with the international community to press for an immediate ceasefire and deliver desperately needed aid to the region‚Äôs people.
"The pharmaceutical industry charges Americans $686 for two EpiPens that can be purchased in Australia for just $169.
 
Let me be clear: It‚Äôs time to take on the greed of the pharmaceutical industry."
"Today, with seven of my Senate colleagues, I sent a letter to Kaiser Permanente Chair and CEO Greg Adams in support of the more than 30,000 nurses and health care workers planning to strike unless negotiations for a fair contract improve."
"Poll after poll shows overwhelming support for the Build Back Better legislation. The American people are saying loudly and clearly: We want government to work for us, not the billionaires."
"On Veterans Day, I spoke to a large crowd in St. Albans, Vermont. We must never forget the sacrifices that so many of our veterans have made."
"We owe our veterans a tremendous debt of gratitude, one which we'll never truly be able to repay. On this Veterans Day let us honor the extraordinary sacrifice and bravery of our veterans and their families, and make certain they get all the benefits they need and were promised."
"The time is now for Congress to finally listen to the American people and not the wealthy and large corporations.

65% of Americans support raising taxes on large corporations. Let‚Äôs do it."
"67% of the American people support universal pre-K.
61% of the American people support tuition-free community college.
 
We MUST invest in the future of our children. NOW."
71 percent of Americans support raising taxes on the wealthiest 2%. Tax the rich.
"The American people have been clear:
 
88% support lower prescription drug prices.
84% support Medicare coverage for dental, vision, and hearing.
73% support paid family and medical leave.
 
Here‚Äôs a radical idea: Let‚Äôs listen to the American people. Let's get it done."
The only way working people can win is when they stand together. That‚Äôs what solidarity is all about.
People all over this country are working longer and longer hours for lower wages. It‚Äôs time for change. It‚Äôs time for government to finally address the long-neglected needs of the working class.
"Yes. In terms of SALT we must protect the middle class from high local and state taxes.But we cannot provide 39% of the benefits to the top 1% ‚Äì as is in the House bill.At a time of massive income inequality we must increase taxes on the 1%, not give them huge tax breaks."
What are the issues that Americans care most strongly about? The polling is clear.
Let me be clear: billionaires do not need more tax breaks.
People are sick and tired of being exploited. People are sick and tired of those on top having so much power over everybody else. The time for transformational change is NOW.
"Cost for one vial of insulin in 1996: $21 
Cost for one vial of insulin in 2018: $320
 
Does anyone really think that makes any sense? No, it‚Äôs barbaric."
"Let me remind my conservative Democratic colleagues who are concerned about fiscal responsibility, the Build Back Better Act will be fully paid for by taxes on the wealthy. The bipartisan infrastructure bill you voted for will add $256billion to the deficit. Let's be consistent."
"A rigged economy is Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos becoming $408 billion richer during the pandemic while, in a given year, paying nothing in federal income taxes. Yes, we must demand that the wealthy pay their fair share of taxes and finally create an economy that works for all of us."
"Days of paid leave offered to new moms:

Absurd. The time is now to finally guarantee paid family and medical leave in this country."
"The people want to lower drug costs. Big Pharma wants to stop us. 
 
The people want to expand Medicare. The health care industry wants to stop us.
 
The people want to combat climate change. The fossil fuel industry wants to stop us.
 
It‚Äôs time Congress listen to the people."
Washington State Dept. of Health reports that unvaccinated 65+ year-olds are 4 times more likely to get COVID compared with fully vaccinated 65+ year-olds; 9 times more likely to be hospitalized and 9 times more likely to die compared with fully vaccinated. Get vaccinated!
Dental care is health care. All Americans must have the right to see a dentist without going into debt.
"Yesterday, conservative House Dems committed to voting for the Build Back Better Act no later than the week of Nov. 15th. Their constituents are watching.They must keep that promise. No excuses. Every Democrat must vote to address the needs of working families &amp; climate change."
"Rebuilding our crumbling roads and bridges by passing the infrastructure bill is important. Addressing the long-neglected needs of working families and climate change is more than important. It is transformational.Now, we must pass a strong Reconciliation bill."
"In 2016, the chairman of Mylan received a $164 million compensation package after his company jacked-up the price of an EpiPen by 550% over a nine-year period.
 
Let me repeat: it‚Äôs time to take on the greed of the pharmaceutical industry."
Solidarity forever.
Tax the wealthy. Address the long-neglected crises of the working class. NOW.
"At a time when some billionaires pay nothing ‚Äì not a nickel ‚Äì in a given year in taxes, yes, it is time for the rich to pay their fair share."
We are RIGHT NOW facing an unbelievable avalanche of money trying to stop an enormously popular agenda. That is what oligarchy is all about.
The wealthiest people in the country do not need a tax break. I‚Äôm live now with @SenatorMenendez to announce a compromise on the SALT deduction.
"According to media reports, Democratic negotiators are working on a repeal of the SALT deduction cap for up to five years, which would cost $475 billion and give the richest 5% $400 billion in tax cuts."
"Maybe ‚Äì just maybe ‚Äì Congress should respond to the demands of the American people and finally expand Medicare to cover dental, vision and hearing."
I want to congratulate Vermont Supreme Court Justice Beth Robinson for her momentous confirmation today to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals. Thank you for your continued service. I know you will make Vermont proud and will be an excellent addition to the federal bench.
The American people want to see Congress take on the big money special interests and address the crises facing working families today. Let‚Äôs get it done.
"There is no rational reason, other than greed, for the pharmaceutical industry to charge the American people $98.70 for a standard unit of insulin that can be purchased in the United Kingdom for just $7.52."
"For far too long, it has not been Congress that  regulates the pharmaceutical industry. It is the pharmaceutical industry that regulates Congress."
Want to hear something really radical? The pharmaceutical industry can charge the American people $242 for the asthma inhaler ‚Äì Flovent Diskus ‚Äì that can be purchased for just $27 in Canada.
A life-saving prescription drug does not mean anything if you cannot afford to buy it.
"Today, with 6 of my colleagues, I sent a letter to Kellogg's CEO in support of the brave workers striking across the country. In a time of record profits and a terrible pandemic, let‚Äôs be clear: Kellogg can afford to treat workers with dignity."
Three words: tax the wealthy.
I‚Äôm standing in solidarity today with the brave McDonald‚Äôs workers on strike to demand the company finally address the epidemic of sexual harassment.
"In our country today, we pay more per capita for prescription drugs than any other major country on Earth. 

Enough. It‚Äôs time to put an end to Big Pharma controlling Congress. It‚Äôs time for Congress to regulate Big Pharma."
"It's time to tell the pharmaceutical industry, loudly and clearly, it doesn‚Äôt own Congress."
"Here‚Äôs who wants Medicare to negotiate lower drug prices:

91% of Democrats
85% of Independents
76% of Republicans 
84% of seniors 
 
It‚Äôs time to listen to the American people. Congress must finally have the courage to stand up to the greed of Big Pharma."
"I want to congratulate the pharmaceutical industry.While 1 out of 4 Americans can't afford to fill their prescriptions, and over 25% of diabetics ration insulin, the industry made over $50 billion in profits last year and the top 10 CEOs made $500 million. Greed. Greed. Greed."
"Income and wealth inequality is a profound moral issue this country must address. The richest 2 Americans cannot continue owning more wealth than the bottom 40% of our country, while millions of working Americans cannot afford the basic necessities to live."
"Let me be very, very clear ‚Äì it‚Äôs time to tax the rich."
"The expansion of Medicare to cover dental, hearing and vision is one of the most popular and important provisions in the entire reconciliation bill. It‚Äôs what the American people want. It‚Äôs not coming out."
Anybody who believes we can create the meaningful change this country needs without standing up to the greed and corruption of the ruling class is sorely mistaken.
"The ruling class of this country is nervous. They know more and more people are realizing they have the right to live in peace, the right to live with dignity. And that is a very real threat to their greed."
"The days of billionaires running Washington is going to end. We are finally going to make sure government stands up for ordinary Americans, not the wealthy and powerful."
"I‚Äôve been criticized for being an ""alarmist"" on climate change. That‚Äôs right. I am alarmed. Climate change is a global emergency and a major national security threat.

We must bring the world together and take on the existential threat of climate change NOW. This can't wait."
"In the richest country in the history of the world, no one should die because they can‚Äôt afford the medicine they need. NO ONE."
"Let me ask you a question. Does it make sense to you that in America today, 2 billionaires own more wealth than the bottom 40% and the top 1% owns more wealth than the bottom 92%?"
"For the THIRD time this year, the GOP blocked common sense voting rights legislation in the Senate. After failing to win the last election, they are doing all they can to steal the next one. What a disgrace. We are going to protect and expand voting rights in this country."
"With unprecedented fires, drought, heat waves, floods and extreme weather disturbances, what's radical is not transforming our energy systems away from fossil fuel and into energy efficiency and sustainable energy. What's radical is doing nothing as our planet gets destroyed."
"Look, I‚Äôm a bit old-fashioned. I happen to believe we should do what the people are demanding, and what the people are demanding is that we finally take on the ruling class of this country."
"You know what? Maybe, just maybe, the rich should pay their fair share of taxes."
I am more than a little tired of the United States being the only major country on Earth to not guarantee paid family and medical leave. We are going to end that international embarrassment.
"Is anyone really satisfied with a system that allows for nearly 1 out of 4 Americans to not be able to afford their prescription drugs, while six of the largest pharmaceutical companies make nearly $50 billion in profits? I don‚Äôt think so."
"At a time of massive income inequality, the billionaire class is opposing our agenda because they want to prevent Congress from making them finally pay their fair share of taxes. We must put an end to their greed."
"What if we did something ‚Äúradical‚Äù and built a government that fought for working class people, and not just billionaires?"
"The corporate media and corporate-funded politicians do not talk about it often, but we now face grotesque income and wealth inequality.No. It is not acceptable for two billionaires to own more wealth than the bottom 40%, or the top 1% to own more than the bottom 92%."
"I‚Äôm proud to stand in solidarity with @UAW workers at John Deere now on strike who are fighting for decent wages, pensions and retirement health care benefits. They are entitled to be treated with respect and dignity, and I applaud their courage and determination."
"As part of our corrupt, big-money dominated political system, Big Pharma is spending hundreds of millions of dollars on lobbying, campaign contributions and television ads because they want Americans to continue paying, by far, the highest prices in the world for medicine."
"Poll after poll shows overwhelming support for the $3.5 trillion Build Back Better legislation. Yet, polling also shows that a majority of Americans have very little knowledge as to what is in this bill."
"88% believe we should lower prescription drug costs
84% think we should expand Medicare
73% support establishing Paid Family and Medical Leave
67% want universal Pre-K
 
Here's a radical idea - let's listen to the American people. Let's get it done."
"I proudly stand in solidarity with every single worker who is right now fighting to build an economy based on human needs, not corporate greed."
"In order to address the long-neglected needs of the working class and combat the existential threat of climate change, we proposed a $6 trillion bill. $3.5 trillion is already a compromise."
"How long will we continue to ignore the destructive forces of climate change? How many more people have to suffer the consequences of our inaction? 
 
Enough is enough. We must combat climate change NOW."
"How is it that we have trillions of dollars to spend on endless wars, but we don‚Äôt have the money to address the needs of the working class?

How is it that we have money for tax breaks for billionaires, but not enough to invest in American families? 

Give me a break."
"Now is the time to restore the faith of the American people in their government, to show them that we in fact can deliver for them, that we can improve their lives. 
 
Let‚Äôs take on the lobbyists. Let‚Äôs take on the billionaires and powerful interests. Let‚Äôs get it done."
I think it is a little absurd that the United States is the only major country on Earth not to guarantee paid family and medical leave as a right. Don‚Äôt you?
"The top 1% now has more wealth than the entire middle class. Does that make sense to anyone?
 
Yes. It‚Äôs time for Congress to take on the greed of the billionaires and deliver for the working class of this country."
"A recent poll found that 83% of Americans support allowing Medicare to negotiate lower drug prices.
 
The American people are making themselves pretty clear. Congress needs to stand up to the greed of the pharmaceutical industry. Now is the time."
"Question: Given the overwhelming support of the reconciliation bill from the American people, why is it taking so long for Congress to pass this bill?
 
Answer: Follow the money."
Now is the #TimeToDeliver for the working class of this country.
"Now is the time, finally, for Congress to stand up for working families and take on the big money interests and wealthy campaign contributors who have so much power over the economic and political life of our country."
"As part of the Reconciliation Bill, Americans want to lower prescription drug costs (88%) and expand Medicare to cover dental, vision and hearing (84%).Both proposals are strongly opposed by drug companies and private insurance.The Dems must stand with the people, not fold."
"Who wants Medicare to negotiate lower drug prices? Oh just...
 
91% of Democrats
85% of Independents
76% of Republicans 
84% of seniors 
 
Now is the time for Congress to finally have the courage to stand up to the greed of Big Pharma."
"We must stand up to a corrupt oligarchy. It is not acceptable that the top 1% now owns more wealth than our entire middle class. We must pass the $3.5 trillion Build Back Better Act, invest in the working class &amp; take on the greed of the billionaires by taxing the rich."
"From the first days of this country, Native Americans were lied to, their treaties violated and their rights ignored. Today on #IndigenousPeoplesDay, we recommit to stand with them in the fight for justice and dignity."
"Maybe, just maybe, Congress might want to serve the needs of the American people, and not wealthy campaign contributors. A new CBS poll finds overwhelming support for these provisions in the $3.5T Reconciliation Bill."
"Americans don't know what's in the Build Back Better plan because the corporate media doesn't discuss it. Let's stop the beltway gossip and start talking about lowering prescription drug costs, expanding Medicare, childcare and housing ‚Äì and combatting climate change."
"Pharma has spent hundreds of millions opposing our efforts to lower prescription drug costs. Meanwhile, the six major drug companies made $50 billion in profits last year and pay their CEOs outrageous salaries.We must stop Pharma greed and pass the Reconciliation Bill."
"The $3.5 trillion reconciliation bill is enormously popular. A recent Quinnipiac University Poll shows 57 percent of the American people support it, including 92 percent of Democrats. Obviously it is exactly the bill that a Democratic Congress should pass."
"The majority of the American people support the $3.5T reconciliation bill. 48 out of 50 Democrats in the Senate support the bill. 96% of Democrats in the House support the bill. 

No. Two people cannot sabotage what the overwhelming majority of this country want."
"The time is long overdue for Sen. Manchin to say with specificity - we're beyond generalities - what he wants, and what he does not want, and to explain that to the people of West Virginia and America."
The question before Congress right now is pretty simple: Do we fulfil what democracy is supposed to be about and stand up for working families or do we bow down to powerful special interests?
"I‚Äôve heard Senator Manchin talk about not wanting to see our country become ‚Äòan entitlement society.‚Äô Well, I‚Äôm not exactly sure what that means."
I'm LIVE to talk about the reconciliation bill that a number of us are fighting for and to make some brief comments about what Sen. Joe Manchin said today about the legislation.
"Big money special interests are spending hundreds of millions of dollars trying to prevent Congress from doing what the American people want. Unacceptable.

Maybe, just maybe, now is the time for Congress to stand up for American families, not for the wealthy and powerful."
"Wall Street and corporate CEOs are ""deeply concerned"" about the U.S. defaulting on our national debt.Yet, they keep providing campaign funds for Republicans, the party which refuses to pay the bill on the spending incurred during the Trump years.Total hypocrisy."
Let us be clear. The Republican Party is refusing to take on the greed of the pharmaceutical industry which charges Americans by far the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs. What a disgrace.
"Wealth of Mark Zuckerberg in 2009: $2 billion

Wealth of Mark Zuckerberg today: $122 billion

Yes. It's time to break up Facebook, break up Big Tech &amp; demand that the wealthy &amp; powerful pay their fair share of taxes. We cannot continue to let Facebook put profits over safety."
"The Republican Party's lust for power and political gain is so great that they are prepared to default on the debt they voted for under Trump, and plunge the world's economy into chaos and depression. To call that ""irresponsible"" would be a major understatement."
"We‚Äôre taking on corporate lobbyists.
 
We‚Äôre taking on powerful special interests.
 
We‚Äôre taking on the entire ruling class of this country.
 
And poll after poll shows that is exactly what the American people want us to do."
"Senior citizens in America should not have to be toothless or lack hearing aids or eyeglasses. Dental care, hearing and vision are essential parts of healthcare. The American people want us to expand Medicare to cover these basic services. That's what we must do."
"As the planet becomes warmer, as unprecedented fires, drought, floods, and extreme weather disturbances cause mass destruction, and when scientists tell us that we only have a few years to avoid irreparable damage to our planet, are we really going to ignore this global crisis?"
"We are trying to pass the most consequential legislation for working people since the Great Depression.

The American people overwhelmingly support it.

The special interests and the billionaires oppose it.

This is a democracy. Maybe, just maybe, we should listen to the people."
"The time is now. Do we do what the American people want? Do we fulfill what democracy is supposed to be about? Or does Congress, yet again, bow down to powerful special interests?
 
That's what this struggle is about."
"The Reconciliation Bill is transformational. It's about taking on Pharma to lower prescription drug costs, the fossil fuel industry to combat climate change, the insurance companies to expand Medicare and demanding the rich pay their fair share. If we stand together, we win."
"Congrats to the House Progressive Caucus and other Dems who insisted that Congress pass BOTH the Infrastructure Bill and the Reconciliation Bill. Now is the time to stand with working families and take on the greed ofPharma, the fossil fuel industry and the billionaire class."
"The mainstream media has it wrong. Delaying the infrastructure vote won't be a ""setback"" for Biden. It will be a major step towards passing the most transformative piece of legislation since the New Deal. There can be no infrastructure bill without a strong reconciliation bill."
"Poll after poll shows that the $3.5T reconciliation bill is immensely popular, despite what some television pundits might say.

Let‚Äôs deliver for the American people. Let‚Äôs get it done."
The fate of the planet is at stake. Without a strong reconciliation bill there will be no serious effort to cut carbon emissions &amp; transform our energy system away from fossil fuel. There must be no infrastructure bill without a major reconciliation bill to combat climate change.
"The military budget is now about $780 billion a year. Over a 10-year period, that is more than DOUBLE what the reconciliation bill will be. And yet, I hear very little discussion about throwing money at the military industrial complex. Shocking!"
"There will be no real progress in this country unless we have the courage to take on Wall Street, the insurance companies, the drug companies, the fossil fuel industry, and all the other forces of greed."
"Wealth inequality is a profound moral and economic issue this country must address. 

The richest two Americans cannot continue owning more wealth than the bottom 40% of our country while millions cannot afford the basics to live."
"One of the great crises facing our democracy is the power of the billionaire class over our political process. Congress must have the courage to take them on and fight for their constituents, not their billionaire campaign contributors."
"Those who want to maintain the status quo in which the rich get richer while ordinary Americans struggle to make ends meet oppose the reconciliation bill.

Well, I disagree. Now is the time, finally, for Congress to stand up for working families."
"In the richest country in the history of the world, no one should have to suffer or die because they can‚Äôt afford the medicine their doctor prescribes to them."
"It‚Äôs time we do what other industrialized countries do and understand that the most important investment we can make is in children. It‚Äôs time we make pre-K education for 3-and 4-year-olds free. Yes, that is right‚Äîfree."
"Let‚Äôs be crystal clear. If the bipartisan infrastructure bill is passed on its own on Thursday, this will be in violation of an agreement that was reached within the Democratic Caucus in Congress."
"The major corporations want Congress to lift the debt ceiling. Yet, they continue to make massive campaign contributions to the Republican Party which refuses to pay the debt incurred under Trump, and is prepared to plunge the economy into a depression. Bullshit!"
"The pharmaceutical industry doesn‚Äôt want us to lower the cost of prescription drugs.
The health care industry doesn‚Äôt want us to expand Medicare.
The fossil fuel industry doesn‚Äôt want us to tackle climate change. 

This is an enormous struggle. And we're going to win it."
This is America. The elderly shouldn't walk around without teeth and be unable to afford a dentist. Grandparents shouldn't be unable to talk with their family because they can't afford hearing aids. Seniors shouldn't be unable to read newspapers because they can‚Äôt afford glasses.
Far too many young people are unable to obtain the good-paying jobs that are out there because they lack the higher education. It‚Äôs long due time that every American have the right to two years of free community college.
"Many of my Republican colleagues don't believe that climate change is real, or they don't believe that we should do anything about it. They are dead wrong. 

If we are to build a future for our children and grandchildren, we must begin by addressing the climate crisis. Period."
"Nearly two-thirds of our seniors have no dental insurance and no idea how they will afford to go to a dentist. That is a disgrace, and it must end."
"Today, there are almost 600,000 people sleeping out on the streets of the wealthiest country in the world. There are 18 million households spending 50% of their limited incomes on housing.

It‚Äôs time to build affordable housing and create good-paying jobs in the process."
"Dental care is health care. We must expand Medicare to include dental, hearing aids &amp; eyeglasses. 71% of Black Medicare recipients, 65% of Hispanic Medicare recipients, 70% of low-income enrollees and 59% living in rural areas did not see a dentist in the past year. Unacceptable."
"It is not a radical idea to say that every family in America should be entitled to high quality and affordable child care. Under the Build Back Better Plan, no working family in this country will be paying more than 7% of their income on child care."
It is a bit embarrassing that our great country is the only major country on Earth not to guarantee paid family and medical leave. That MUST change.
"The pharmaceutical industry employs nearly 1,500 lobbyists in Washington, DC alone - including the former congressional leaders in both major political parties. Got that? That‚Äôs almost three prescription drug lobbyists for every Member of Congress."
"The overriding motivation of the pharmaceutical industry is greed. Their overriding goal is to make as much money as they can by squeezing as much as they possibly can out of the sick, out of the elderly and out of the desperate."
"I will not tell the young people that we can't address the climate crisis.
I will not tell people that are homeless that we can't build affordable housing. 
I will not tell families that we can't make child care affordable.

We must address the needs of the working class."
The time is now to finally address the long-neglected needs of the working class. I'm LIVE on the floor of the Senate talking about why we must pass the $3.5 trillion reconciliation bill.
"Poll after poll shows that the American people want fundamental and transformational change. It‚Äôs time to listen to them, not the wealthy and the powerful."
"68,000 Americans die each and every year because they cannot afford to get the health care that they need when they need it.
 
In other words, the greed of the prescription drug industry is killing Americans."
"For far too long, it has not been Congress that has been regulating the pharmaceutical industry. It has been the pharmaceutical industry that has been regulating Congress."
Enough is enough. A life-saving prescription drug does not work if you cannot afford to buy it.
"The historic expansion of the child tax credit, passed earlier this year under the American Rescue Plan, helped lower child poverty in this country by more than 50%. Pretty good. But we cannot stop there. We must extend it now."
"Today, nearly one out of every four Americans cannot afford the medications that their doctors prescribe.

Enough is enough. It is time to end the corporate greed of the pharmaceutical industry and lower the cost of prescription drugs."
"All over this country, the American people are asking a simple question: How many people need to die, how many people need to get unnecessarily sicker before Congress is prepared to take on the greed of the prescription drug industry?"
"Last year, the six largest drug companies in the U.S. made nearly $50 billion dollars in profits. Meanwhile, Americans pay, by far, the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs. That disgrace has got to end."
"The pharmaceutical industry, over the last 20 years, has spent over $4.5 billion dollars on lobbying and campaign contributions. They have hundreds of lobbyists on Capitol Hill right now to fight any bill that will lower the cost of prescription drugs."
"Moral policy is good politics. When you stand up for working families and protect future generations, that not only is the right thing to do, but it is also what the American people want."
"I‚Äôm very glad my home state of Vermont will be welcoming 100 Afghan refugees in the coming weeks. This is exactly what we should be doing, and I have no doubt that they will enrich, and contribute immeasurably, to our state."
"The pharmaceutical industry doesn‚Äôt want us to lower the cost of prescription drugs. The fossil fuel industry wants to continue making profits off of destroying the planet. 

We must show the American people that government represents them, not powerful interest groups."
"We are taking on the ruling class, we are taking on the oligarchs, we are taking on the pharmaceutical industry, we are taking on the health care industry, we are taking on the fossil fuel industry. But if we stand together, we will win."
"Yes, we must pass the most consequential piece of legislation for working families since the 1930s and prove that our government can work for them, and not just for the wealthy and powerful."
"79% of the American people believe that the cost of prescription drugs is too high.
 
Is it radical for Congress to represent the American people and address their long-neglected needs? No. I don‚Äôt think so."
"The American people pay higher prices for prescription drugs than people in almost every other major country on Earth.
 
Does that make any sense to you?"
"The reality of today is that poverty is a death sentence in America. The wealthiest people live, on average, 10-15 years longer than the poorest.

We must expand Medicare. We must invest in child care. We must pay workers a living wage. We must take care of our people."
The richest people on Earth should pay more than $0 in federal income taxes. Period.
"Question: Why do we pay, by far, the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs? Answer: The pharmaceutical industry has spent $4.5 billion over the last 20 years in lobbying and campaign contributions.Congress must have the courage NOW to lower drug prices."
"In the fight against climate change, we have a choice: protect the profits of the fossil fuel industry or protect the future of our children."
"We must end a rigged system that allowed the former CEO of Gilead to become a billionaire by charging $1,000 for a Hepatitis C drug that was developed by the VA, costs $1 to manufacture &amp; can be purchased in India for $4. No more excuses. Congress must lower drug prices NOW."
"At a time of massive and growing income &amp; wealth inequality and as the top 1% has more wealth than the bottom 92%, now is the time to demand that the wealthy and large corporations pay their fair share so that we can begin to address the long neglected needs of working families."
"I'm very disappointed in the vote today on prescription drugs by the House Energy and Commerce Committee. 

I get that the pharmaceutical industry owns the Republican Party and that no Republican voted for this bill, but there is no excuse for every Democrat not supporting it."
"If we can pass bold legislation NOW that invests in them, we can show the American people that government can work for all of us, and not just the wealthy few."
"This is what oligarchy looks like: The drug companies, the healthcare industry, fossil fuel interests and the very rich are spending millions to defeat our legislation to protect working families and create a progressive tax system. Enough is enough. Their greed must be defeated."
"Here in Washington, when we go to war: there's endless amounts of money

Tax breaks for billionaires: endless amounts of money

But when we want to support working American families, suddenly we don't have enough money. Unacceptable."
Is demanding that the wealthiest people in the country and the largest corporations finally pay their fair share of taxes radical? No. What‚Äôs radical is the very rich not paying a nickel in federal income tax while the needs of the working class of this country are neglected.
"Maybe, just maybe, at a time of massive income and wealthy inequality, when two people own more wealth than the bottom 40%, now is the time to address the needs of our people."
"What the data tells us is clear: when government responds to the needs of the working class, millions of families are lifted out of poverty. 

We must not stop here. We must pass the $3.5T reconciliation bill and invest in working families."
"The American Rescue Plan showed what good and moral policy can do. For example, it helped reduce childhood poverty in the US by 50%.
 
But it would be a shame to stop there. Let‚Äôs pass the reconciliation bill. Let‚Äôs transform our economy to work for the many, not just the few."
"Whether you're a Republican, a Democrat or an Independent, Americans understand that right now, the richest people in this country and the largest corporations are doing phenomenally well while the middle class of this country struggles.

That is going to change."
"Oregon is burning. California is burning. Siberia is burning. People are drowning in New York City. Detroit is flooding. There is drought all over the world. This is a climate crisis. 

The United States must lead the world in transforming our energy system away from fossil fuel."
"Physical infrastructure is terribly important. But I also think that the needs of the human beings of our country ‚Äì working families, the children, the elderly, the poor ‚Äì are even more important. 

We can and must take care of both."
"20 years later, we pause to remember the thousands of lives lost on September 11, 2001, and the bravery of so many first responders who put their lives at risk to save others."
"I have absolute confidence that if we have the courage and the determination to stand together and fight for justice, not only can we address the enormous crises that we face, but I believe we can move this country in a much stronger and better direction."
"At a time of massive wealth and income inequality, we can no longer tolerate a rigged tax system that allows the top 1% to avoid $163 billion in taxes that they owe. Yes, we will demand that the 1% pays its fair share and we will use that revenue to invest in working families."
"The science is clear: if we do not address climate change now, we will suffer greater and more frequent climate disasters and the Earth will become increasingly uninhabitable. 
 
It‚Äôs time we listen to scientists, not the fossil fuel industry."
"Yes, we are going to raise taxes on large, profitable corporations ‚Äì many that in a given year don‚Äôt pay a nickel in federal income tax."
For too many years the government has been there for the wealthy and the powerful. Now is the time for the government to be there for the working families of this country.
"On this Labor Day we thank the trade union movement for their ongoing struggle for justice. Yes. Every American is entitled to the right to join a union, decent wages and benefits, affordable housing, health care and educational opportunity. Let us go forward in solidarity."
"Thank you to the over 900 Vermonters who joined our town meetings this weekend in Springfield, Newport, and St. Johnsbury. If you haven‚Äôt had a chance to come out, please join us tomorrow in Brattleboro and Middlebury!"
"Let's be clear. Climate change is causing devastating harm in the U.S. and around the world. Not to pass the $3.5 trillion reconciliation bill, which has unprecedented spending to cut carbon emissions, would be grossly irresponsible. We must pass this bill and save the planet."
"There is an enormous amount of work to be done as we transform our energy system away from fossil fuel and cut carbon emissions, and hundreds of thousands of members of the Civilian Climate Corps are going to be at the forefront of that struggle."
"Rebuilding our crumbling physical infrastructure ‚Äì roads, bridges, water systems ‚Äì is important. Rebuilding our crumbling human infrastructure ‚Äì health care, education, climate change ‚Äì is more important. No infrastructure bill without the $3.5 trillion reconciliation bill."
"Vermonters: My Labor Day Weekend Town Meetings are coming up! RSVP now to join me and other special guests for good food, good music, and good discussion. I hope to see you this weekend."
"Even after the devastation caused by Hurricane Ida, my Republican colleagues will say combatting climate change is too expensive. 

I ask again: compared to what? More flooding, power outages, droughts, heat waves, and extreme weather events? We need transformative change NOW."
"Sadly, the Republican Party has turned its back on democracy and instead focused on massive voter suppression. We must make it easier for people to vote ‚Äì not harder."
"Remember some of the same people who tell us we can‚Äôt afford to make community college free or provide paid family leave, all support massive tax breaks for the wealthy and big corporations."
"Nearly half a century ago, the Supreme Court affirmed abortion as a constitutional right. This Supreme Court's refusal to overturn Texas‚Äô law banning abortion is outrageous. Women get to control their bodies, not politicians and not judges."
"This is what oligarchy and a corrupt political system are all about. The rich and large corporations get richer, and their lobbyists do everything possible to protect their wealth and greed. Not this time. We must pass a Reconciliation Bill that works for all, not just the few."
Vermonters: Join me this Labor Day Weekend for town meetings across the state with live music and food! I‚Äôll be discussing the $3.5 trillion reconciliation bill and how it will finally address the needs of working families here in Vermont and all across our country.
It is unacceptable to me that seniors in the richest country on earth cannot afford the hearing aids or the eyeglasses they need to hear and see their grandchildren.
"At a time when tens of millions of people are working for starvation wages, Republicans think they can starve people back to work. That is unacceptable."
"The destruction from Hurricane Ida is devastating. Our thoughts are with those in danger and with first responders saving lives. But let's be clear. If we do not act boldly to combat climate change, what we see today will become the norm as the planet becomes more uninhabitable."
"Republicans L-O-V-E to give tax breaks to billionaires and large corporations, so I understand why they might be a little shocked that we are finally going to invest in working families.

It‚Äôs time to create an economy that works for all of us, not just the 1%."
"I've got a message for the healthcare industry: Your days of writing legislation are over. We will expand Medicare to provide dental, vision and hearing coverage to benefit seniors, not to pad the profits of healthcare industry CEOs. And we will do it by taking on your greed."
"Today, we mourn the loss of the members of the U.S. military killed at Kabul Airport. These soldiers played an extraordinary role in helping to evacuate over 80,000 people ‚Äì Americans and Afghans.Their bravery and sacrifice will not be forgotten."
"Nearly 18 million households are paying over 50% of their incomes on housing. That is absurd.
 
It‚Äôs time for bold action. It‚Äôs time for an unprecedented investment in affordable housing."
"Congratulations to Speaker Pelosi and House Democrats for passing the $3.5 trillion Budget Resolution. Now, let us move forward aggressively to transform this country by passing both the Reconciliation Bill and the Infrastructure Bill. Working families are counting on us."
"Unless Congress passes the reconciliation bill, the $300 monthly checks sent to every working family in America will expire in December. We cannot let that happen. These checks are a big reason why childhood poverty in America has been cut by 61%. No reconciliation bill, no deal."
"Unless we pass the reconciliation bill:

-Seniors won't get dental, vision, hearing &amp; home care

-Drug prices will soar

-Families will be denied $300 a month per kid

-Climate change will worsen.

-Families won't receive childcare &amp; affordable housing

No reconciliation, no deal"
"Since 2009, 45% of all new income has gone into the hands of the wealthiest 1%. 

Is that acceptable to you?"
"Rebuilding our crumbling physical infrastructure is very important.Rebuildingour human infrastructure, the needs of working families, the children, the elderly and the sick, is more important.No bipartisan infrastructure bill without the reconciliation bill.They go together."
The cost of going to a dentist has gone up by more than 80 percent since 1990.
"A huge fire in Siberia is casting smoke for 3,000 miles. 

Greece: burning. 

California: burning. 

Oregon: burning. 

July 2021 was the hottest month ever recorded. 

We must combat climate change now."
"In the past, the disasters we are seeing around the world might have seemed like an absurd plot in some apocalypse movie. Unfortunately, this is our new reality, and it will only get much worse in years to come if we do not act boldly ‚Äì now."
"We live in a time where many Americans have lost faith that their government can work for them. How do we combat that? We start by passing the most consequential piece of legislation for working people, the elderly, the children, the sick and the poor since FDR and the New Deal."
61 million kids received direct payments of up to $300 in August from the expanded Child Tax Credit. That is no small thing. It‚Äôs how we start to end the international embarrassment of the U.S. having one of the highest rates of childhood poverty of any major country.
Republicans used the budget process to give trillions of dollars in tax breaks to the wealthy and powerful. We‚Äôre going to use it a little bit differently and finally invest in the long-neglected needs of the working class.
"Foreign policy matters: After 20 years of U.S. effort, the loss of 2,448 soldiers and a trillion spent, Afghanistan was left with a corrupt government and an ineffectual military. At this moment, we must do everything we can to evacuate our allies and open our doors to refugees."
"86 years ago, FDR signed Social Security into law. Since then, through good times and bad, Social Security has paid every benefit owed to every eligible American on time and without delay. Our job now is to expand, not cut, Social Security so that everyone can retire in dignity."
"If you think that the forest fires in Oregon, California, Montana, and elsewhere are an aberration, that they are once-in-a-lifetime, you are dead wrong. 

If we do not come together to address climate change NOW, it will be too late."
It is time to end the international disgrace of the United States being the only major country on Earth not to guarantee paid family and medical leave as a right.
"Today, 18 million households spend 50 percent of their limited incomes on housing. How does that make any sense?
We must build low-income and affordable housing, and when we do that, we will create a heck of a lot of good-paying jobs."
"July was the hottest month EVER recorded on Earth. I'm growing tired of many people ‚Äì especially my Republican friends ‚Äì asking, ‚Äúhow can we afford to act on climate change?‚Äù The real question is: how can we afford NOT to?"
"At a time when corporate profits are soaring, when major corporations are making billions a year while not paying a nickel in federal income tax, we are going to end the grotesque greed of the obscenely wealthy. We are going to demand that they pay their fair share."
"Huge fires in Siberia with smoke spreading more than 3,000 miles.Major fires in Greece, California and Oregon.Heat wave in Italy. Increased drought throughout the planet. We're in this together. The entire world must unite to combat climate change. There is no choice."
"In America, I have met with low-income women who give birth and then have to go back to work in a week or two because they don't have the money to stay home. We are going to end that international embarrassment. We are going to have guaranteed paid family and medical leave."
"In real inflation accounted-for dollars, many workers today are not making a nickel more than they did 50 years ago. Half of our people are living paycheck to paycheck.

In the richest country in the history of the world, that is unacceptable."
"I understand that Republican Leader Mitch McConnell is shocked that for once in a very long time the Congress is going to stand with working families and not on the side of the rich and powerful. 

As he has made very clear, his philosophy is the polar opposite."
Unprecedented times require unprecedented action. I‚Äôm LIVE on the Senate floor NOW as we start debate on the most consequential legislation for the working class since the New Deal.
"Today, the top 1% own more wealth than the bottom 92%. Since 2009, 45% of all new income has gone into the hands of the 1%.

The time is long overdue for Congress to address the long-neglected needs of the working class."
"The IPCC is telling us what every sane person knows. Unless there is BOLD action to combat climate change, the planet we will be leaving our kids and future generations will be increasingly uninhabitable. Now is the time for action."
"The $3.5 trillion Budget Resolution that I am introducing today will allow the Senate to move forward on a reconciliation bill that will be the most consequential piece of legislation for working people, the elderly, the children, the sick and the poor since FDR and the New Deal."
"Oregon and California are burning.Greece is burning. The entire planet is experiencing a major drought. Yet, as they continue to defend the fossil fuel industry, many of my Republican colleagues deny the reality of climate change. 

Pathetic."
"Our political task is not just to improve life for working families in terms of decent income, health care, education, etc.It is to change the political paradigm so that people demand their full rights as human beings, and not just scraps from the table."
This extension is important and will bring much-needed relief to millions. But we can‚Äôt stop here. We must continue fighting to cancel student debt and make public colleges and universities tuition-free and debt-free.
"Thank you Elle Purrier St. Pierre for taking Vermont into the 1,500-meter Olympic finals. Your hard work and dedication is an inspiration to the young people of Vermont and America.Keep up the great work!"

"My Republican colleagues don‚Äôt think we should do anything about climate change. They are dead wrong.
 
We‚Äôre going to act and act boldly by passing major legislation to transform our energy system away from fossil fuels. The future of the planet is at stake."
"Richard Trumka was a son of the American working class, and he never forgot where he came from.Over the years he and I worked together on many issues.He was a friend and I am saddened by his passing.Jane and I send our deepest condolences to the Trumka family."
"In my view, this reconciliation bill is the most consequential legislation for working people since the New Deal. Let‚Äôs get it done."
"Elle Purrier St. Pierre, Vermont's most famous dairy farmer, fought her way into the women's Olympic 1,500-meter final! Congratulations,
Elle."
"As we combat a deadly pandemic that caused a level of economic suffering we‚Äôve not seen in this country since the Great Depression, we cannot allow families to be thrown out on the street. Today‚Äôs extension of the eviction moratorium is life-changing news for millions of people."
We cannot allow people to be thrown onto the streets. We must extend the eviction moratorium.
The Senate will soon begin considering a transformational piece of legislation. I'm on the floor NOW giving remarks about what's in it.
"It‚Äôs outrageous that in the middle of a deadly pandemic the eviction moratorium has ended. I‚Äôm proud to stand with @RepCori, @AOC and so many demanding the government respond to the needs of working people and extend it. We cannot allow people to be thrown onto the streets."
"Elle Purrier St. Pierre, the Montgomery, Vermont dairy farmer, advanced tonight to the women's 1,500-meter semifinal in Tokyo. Congratulations, Elle. Vermont is rooting for you!"
Less than 0.004% of fully vaccinated people had a breakthrough case that led to hospitalization and less than 0.001% of fully vaccinated people died from a breakthrough Covid-19 case.GET VACCINATED.
Rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure is important. Addressing the long-neglected needs of working familiesis even more important.And we MUST address the existential threat of climate change.There can be no infrastructure bill without a reconciliation bill.
"If you paid $20 to mail a Federal Express package overnight, you paid more to Federal Express than it paid in federal income taxes over the past 3 years after making over $8.2 billion in profits. Yes, we are going to demand that companies like FedEx pay their fair share of taxes."
"It‚Äôs a disgrace that the eviction moratorium is about to expire. Rent is due tomorrow. In case anyone forgot, we've been going through a deadly pandemic that caused an economic crisis. We can‚Äôt allow families to be thrown out on the street. Congress and the White House must act."
"In 1965, half of seniors over the age of 65 had no medical insurance. The passage of Medicare 56 years ago today ended that injustice. 

Now is the time to lower the Medicare eligibility age to at least 60 and expand the program to include dental, vision, and hearing care."
"I had the honor of serving with Carl in the Senate for a number of years. He was a man of intelligence, decency and commitment. Jane and I send our condolences to the Levin family."
"At a time of unprecedented heatwaves, drought, flooding, extreme weather, and the acidification of the oceans, now is the time for us to make certain that the planet we leave future generations is healthy and habitable. That means finally standing up to the fossil fuel industry."
We are going to end the days of billionaires not paying a nickel in federal income taxes.
"I was shocked and saddened to hear of Senator Mike Enzi‚Äôs untimely death. I served as the Ranking Member of the Budget Committee which Mike chaired for several years. I always found him to be friendly, civil and fair to all, regardless of their political views."
The Civilian Climate Corps will provide good jobs and educational benefits to hundreds of thousands of young people who will lead the fight against climate change and help save the planet. Let's get it done.
Today marks 12 YEARS since the last increase in the federal minimum wage. Is it really a shock that a full-time worker making minimum wage in 2021 can‚Äôt afford rent ANYWHERE in the U.S.? It's time to end starvation wages and raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour.
"What would be considered abnormal in every other advanced country on earth?

Medical debt
Deductibles
Unpaid family leave
No paid sick days
No paid vacation
Unaffordable childcare
Billionaires paying nothing in taxes

It is time to make all of these things abnormal in the USA."
"To anybody out there that thinks that climate change is not real, I beg of you, just open your eyes. We are seeing more and more climate disasters every day.
 
We must come together and take on the existential threat of climate change."
Republicans are getting very nervous because we‚Äôre fighting for an extremely popular set of proposals that are long overdue. Let‚Äôs get it done.
"Our reconciliation bill, if passed, will be the most consequential piece of legislation for working people, the elderly, the children, the sick and the poor since FDR and the New Deal of the 1930s.  I‚Äôm live NOW with Rep. Ro Khanna to discuss the details."
"In the richest country in the history of the world, poverty is a death sentence. We‚Äôre holding a hearing NOW on declining life expectancy for working Americans."
"The future of working families is at stake. The future of our democracy is at stake. The future of our planet is at stake.

Now is the time."
"Am I supposed to be impressed that a billionaire went to space while he‚Äôs paid zero in federal income taxes some years and the workers at his company struggle to afford their medical bills, rent, and food for their kids? Nope. It‚Äôs time to invest in working people here on Earth."
"Let us celebrate when we:
- Eradicate poverty
- Provide health care for all
- Abolish homelessness
- Combat climate change
- Provide Universal Pre-K

Let us not celebrate when:
- Billionaires who avoid taxes and exploit workers take a vacation to outer space."
"The Framers gave the power to declare war to Congress, but over many years it has allowed its oversight authority to wane. We are LIVE introducing major legislation to reassert that constitutional power."
"I believe that we have become far too comfortable with the United States engaging in military interventions all over the world, and the time is long overdue for Congress to reassert its constitutional role in matters of war and peace."
I‚Äôm shocked! @FoxNews actually gets it right! This budget bill is going to transform the lives of millions of people.
"What's this budget bill really all about? Well, in a time of massive income and wealth inequality, when nearly half of our people are living paycheck to paycheck, what this bill does is FINALLY begin to address the long-neglected needs of working people. Let's get it done."
"Thank you, Dolly Parton.Hopefully, the people of Tennessee and this country will be listening to you more than your governor."
"Frito-Lay made more than $4.2 billion in sales last year. But they can't be bothered to provide fair wages and safe working conditions? I don‚Äôt think so. I stand with the workers on strike in Topeka. It takes enormous courage to stand up and fight back, and I applaud you."
"As Senate Budget Committee Chairman, I want to give you an update on what's in the budget bill we're working on and why it is the most consequential legislation considered by Congress since the 1930s."
TODAY working families will start receiving direct monthly payments of up to $300 per child as part of the historic expansion of the Child Tax Credit. It is a huge step towards cutting childhood poverty in half and will bring relief to parents and caregivers across the country.
"At a time of massive wealth and income inequality and when half our people are living paycheck to paycheck, what this reconciliation bill will finally do is address the needs of our working families by asking the wealthy and large corporations to pay their fair share of taxes."
"If we do not act on climate change now, our grandchildren are going to look us in the eyes 30 years from now and say, ‚ÄúWhat did you do? Didn‚Äôt you know? How did you let this happen?‚Äù We must lead the world in transforming our energy system away from fossil fuels."
Do not tell me that addressing the existential threat of climate change is radical. Failing to save the planet from climate disasters is radical.
"What we are trying to do, right now, is transformative."
"All people have the right to protest and to live in a democratic society. I call on the Cuban government to respect opposition rights and refrain from violence. It‚Äôs also long past time to end the unilateral U.S. embargo on Cuba, which has only hurt, not helped, the Cuban people."
"As a result of the American Rescue Plan passed several months ago by Congress and signed into law by President Biden, bold action will be taken to cut childhood poverty in half and make it easier for moms, dads, and caregivers to raise their children."
The time is now to finally address the long-term crises facing the working families of this country.
Visiting Vermont summer programs in Burlington and Fairfield. Yes. This is more fun than Senate committee meetings.
"Firenados in northern California. Ocean fires in the Gulf of Mexico. Subway waterfalls in New York City. A heat dome in the Northwest melting power cables, killing hundreds and frying marine animals. I have been told that combatting climate change is expensive. Compared to what?"
"Since 2016, 14 top pharmaceutical companies spent $577 billion on stock buybacks and dividends ‚Äì $56 billion more than research and development. We must lower the outrageous price of prescription drugs in budget reconciliation and use the savings to expand Medicare with 51 votes."
"You will forgive me for not having a lot of patience when some of my colleagues in the Senate tell me that we can‚Äôt afford to act on climate change. Really? The question that we must be asking, as loudly as possible, is how we can afford not to act?"
"On this Fourth of July, let us recommit to building a future that works for all of us, not just the few."
"89% of Democrats &amp; 79% of Republicans support expanding Medicare to include dental, hearing &amp; vision care.

86% of Democrats &amp; 70% of Republicans support providing seniors with home health care.

This is what real bipartisanship looks like, even if all Republicans in DC vote no."
"During the 1930s, as part of FDR's New Deal we electrified the nation.In the 1960s, we sent a man to the moon as part of JFK's space program.Today, we must combat climate change and lead the world away from fossil fuels.We cannot fail. The future of the planet is at stake."
"Millions of Americans cannot see well enough to walk across their living room, can‚Äôt hear well enough to engage in a conversation, or can‚Äôt chew food properly because their teeth are in such bad shape due to the cost of basic care. We must expand Medicare NOW."
"If Mitch McConnell could abolish the filibuster to appoint 3 extreme right wing Supreme Court justices who just voted to gut the Voting Rights Act, you know what? Democrats can and should abolish the filibuster to save democracy and make it easier, not harder, for people to vote."
"Why is it that in the richest country in the history of the world we leave our seniors to suffer? We must expand Medicare to cover eyeglasses, hearing aids and dental."
"Look at what is happening in the Pacific Northwest right now. If we do not significantly invest in transforming our energy system, future generations will never forgive us."
"The time is now to expand Medicare to cover hearing aids, eyeglasses, and dental visits."
"For those who say the budget framework I proposed costs ""too much"" what would you cut?

Combatting climate change?

Childcare?

Universal Pre-K?

Paid family &amp; medical leave?

Dental, hearing &amp; vision?

Housing?

Long-term home health care?

Child Tax Credit?

Waiting..."
Now is the time to lower the Medicare eligibility age.
"The most severe heat in Pacific Northwest history is underway. Predicted to be ‚Äúhistoric, dangerous, prolonged and unprecedented,‚Äù by the National Weather Service, it‚Äôs already rewriting the record books. Yes.We have to act BOLDLY to address climate change."
"Let me be clear: There will not be a bipartisan infrastructure deal without a reconciliation bill that substantially improves the lives of working families and combats the existential threat of climate change. No reconciliation bill, no deal. We need transformative change NOW."
Jane and I are saddened by the passing of Sen. Mike Gravel. He was dedicated to ending forever wars and bringing more Americans into the political process. His courage will be deeply missed. Our thoughts are with his loved ones.
"""The only complaint I‚Äôve ever heard from our members that are able to transfer over to Medicare is that they wish they could have done it sooner,‚Äù says @BMWEDIBT Director of Safety Roy Morrison. The time is NOW to lower the eligibility age for Medicare."
Let‚Äôs get it done.
Medicare must negotiate drug prices and we must substantially lower drug prices for all Americans through the budget reconciliation process.
"No. There's absolutely no way Biogen should be allowed to charge patients $56,000 for the new Alzheimer's drug ‚Äì costing Medicare up to $29 billion a year. We must take on the greed of the pharmaceutical industry."
"Eye glasses, hearing aids, and dentist visits are health care. Period. It‚Äôs time to expand Medicare so millions of Americans can live in dignity."
"Congratulations to Elle Purrier St. Pierre of Montgomery, Vermont on qualifying for the Olympics. Elle, a graduate of Richford High School and UNH, is headed to the summer games in Tokyo after breaking a 32-year-old record in the 1,500 meters Olympic trials."
"It is a disgrace that at a time when authoritarianism, conspiracy theories and political violence are on the rise not a single Republican in the United States Senate has the courage to even debate whether we should protect American democracy or not."
"I‚Äôm on my way to the Senate floor NOW to vote YES on the For the People Act. This is an important moment in the fight to protect our democracy, our elections, and the people's right to vote."
No one in this country should have to wait in line for hours to vote.
"If you paid $12.99 a month for an Amazon Prime membership, you paid more to Amazon than it paid in federal income taxes over the past 3 years combined. 
 
On this #PrimeDay, let us stand with Amazon workers. Let us demand that billionaires pay their fair share."
"I think the average American, whether you‚Äôre Democrat, Republican, or Independent, can agree there is something absurd about two people owning more wealth than the bottom 40% of America and billionaires paying NOTHING in federal income tax."
"As we finally honor Juneteenth as a federal holiday, we must never forget the horrors of slavery and how they affect every aspect of our lives today."
"Yes. Climate change is real. It is already having a devastating impact in the U.S. and around the world, and it will only get worse. That is why any major ""infrastructure"" bill in Congress must include a massive investment in transforming our energy system away from fossil fuels."
"Juneteenth becoming a federal holiday is an important moment in understanding our country's history, and the horrors and lasting legacy of slavery. But real justice is when all Black Americans live free of oppression. That is not the work of a single day, but of every day."
"In a time of massive income and wealth inequality, we have got to have government finally start standing with the working families of this country, not just the rich. That is what this budget is about."
"As Chairman of the Budget Committee, I believe that NOW is the time to address the long-term crises facing working families. And, yes.We can pay for many of these proposals by demanding that the wealthy and large corporations start paying their fair share of taxes."
Disability rights are civil rights. It's time to #DemolishDisabledPoverty once and for all. We must expand SSI.

Every child deserves a quality education free of hunger.
"While 90 million Americans are uninsured or underinsured and while 600,000 died in the pandemic, the CEOs of six health insurance companies made a combined $236 million in 2020, 45% more than in 2019.This is why we need Medicare for All."
"After an unimaginably difficult year, today we celebrate Vermont reaching a major vaccination threshold. Let‚Äôs thank everyone working to keep our community safe. We must also ensure vulnerable Vermonters are protected after the state of emergency order is lifted."
"Space travel, heavily funded by taxpayers, should not be a play thing for the very rich."
"Republican Leader Mitch McConnell said it all.""What we have in the United States Senate is total unity from Susan Collins to Ted Cruz in opposition to what the new Biden administration is trying to do to this country.‚ÄùThat is precisely why we must end the filibuster."
"Last I heard, dental, hearing and vision are part of health care. We must expand Medicare to cover these basic services."
"Income and wealth inequality is soaring, wages for workers have been stagnant for almost 50 years and some billionaires pay nothing in federal income taxes. Hey! Maybe it's time for the government to start representing the middle class, and not just the 1%."
"This week, we couldn‚Äôt get any Senate Republicans to support legislation to guarantee equal pay for equal work. Do we really believe more time and more negotiations will get them to vote for an infrastructure package that truly addresses the crises we face? I don‚Äôt think so."
For decades our government has stood up for the rich and the powerful. It‚Äôs time for the government to stand up for the working class of this country.
"I don‚Äôt want to sound too partisan, but the Republican Party has made clear that they are not prepared to stand up for the American people and address the many crises facing working families today. We can get to work without them."
The time is now to massively invest in our infrastructure and create millions of good-paying union jobs in the process.
"The U.S. must lead the way in crushing the coronavirus pandemic everywhere, and I‚Äôm pleased the Biden Administration has taken strong action to get more people vaccinated around the world. Everyone, rich or poor, deserves the right to get a life-saving Covid-19 vaccine."
"55 of the largest corporations in the U.S. paid no federal corporate income taxes last year, but spent nearly $450 million on lobbying. Outrageous. We must get big money out of politics and create an economy that works for all of us, not just the top 1%."
Enough is enough. Every state in this country has a crumbling infrastructure. Now is the time to put our people back to work by finally addressing the structural problems we face. Let‚Äôs get it done.
"In 2007 and 2011, Jeff Bezos, the wealthiest man alive, paid nothing in federal income taxes.

In 2018, Elon Musk, the 2nd wealthiest person in America, paid nothing in federal income taxes.

Yes. At a time of massive wealth and income inequality, we must tax the rich."
"As we see Republican-led voter suppression efforts across the country, I‚Äôm proud Vermont is expanding voting rights. Congress must act NOW to remove barriers to the ballot box and make it easier for people to vote, not harder."
"LIVE: The Budget Committee is holding a hearing on President Biden's budget proposal, which is the most significant agenda for working families in the modern history of our country. Now is the time to think big, not small."
"If we are serious about calling ourselves a democracy, we need to end voter suppression and make it easier for people to vote."
"On this day in 1944, Allied forces launched the invasion of Normandy to free Europe from Hitler and fascism. Many brave soldiers died defending democracy. We must not forget their sacrifice. The struggle to protect democracy continues. We must not fail."
"No, Judge Benitez. AR-15 rifles are not equivalent to a Swiss Army knife. They are military style weapons that can, and have, killed dozens of people in a few minutes. The American people want common sense gun safety legislation. This decision should be appealed and overturned."
"Hmm. When the GOP passed legislation to provide a $1 trillion tax break to corporations &amp; the 1% without a single Democratic vote, I didn't hear my Republican colleagues say ""Wait. It has to be bipartisan."" Please don't tell me we can't use the same tools to help working people."
"Republicans understand that their agenda of tax breaks for billionaires and cutting Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid is unpopular, so they‚Äôre doing all they can to make it harder to vote in America. Shameful. We are going to go forward to protect democracy."
"I applaud this step by the Biden administration. The United States should lead the effort to vaccinate the world, not only by providing vaccines to poorer countries but also by helping to make the technology available for countries to produce it themselves."
"For the last 48 years real wages for the working class in this country have been stagnant while the very rich have gotten much richer.Today, the top 1% own more wealth than the bottom 92%.Our job is to defeat oligarchy and create an economy that works for all, not just the few."
"If Republicans don't want to cooperate and help us seriously address the many crises we're facing today, then, yes, we have to move forward without them to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure and create millions of good-paying, union jobs."
"The U.S. Senate is the only institution in the world where a vote of 59-41 can be considered a defeat instead of a huge victory. Enough is enough. Let us change the outdated rules of the Senate, end the filibuster and pass a bold agenda for working families with majority vote."
"On Memorial Day, we honor the brave Americans who gave their lives to defend our country. We reaffirm a grateful nation‚Äôs commitment to their loved ones, and to everyone who has served."
"Let's be clear. If 10 Republican Senators cannot even vote for a bipartisan commission to investigate the January 6th insurrection, 10 Republican Senators will not vote for anything meaningful to improve the lives of the American people. We must abolish the filibuster &amp; act now."
"Republicans want a cold war with China because of its growing authoritarianism. That stance is coming from a party that refuses to acknowledge Biden's election victory, investigate the January 6th insurrection, and is working overtime to suppress the vote. What hypocrisy."
"If Democrats stand together to take on powerful special interests and do what so many working families of this country want us to do, we can create an economy that works for all, help save the planet from the ravages of climate change, and strengthen our democracy."
"It's a painful day for American democracy that Republicans blocked the creation of a commission to investigate the Jan. 6th insurrection. I applaud the six Republicans who voted for the commission, but I am saddened that so many are too intimidated by Trump to do the right thing."
"College athletes are workers. They deserve pay, a union, and to own their own name, image, and likeness. We cannot wait for the NCAA to share its billions with the workers who create it. It is long past time we gave these workers the rights they deserve."
"This is an unprecedented moment in American history. The Democrats in Congress must move forward boldly, protecting the working families of our country and restoring faith in government. Yes, the future of the country is at stake."
"In state after state Republican legislatures are working overtime to suppress the vote and create outrageous gerrymandered districts. If Congress does not pass H.R. 1 and S. 1, millions of voters will be disenfranchised and Democrats will become a permanent minority party."
"When we landed on the moon, there was great collective pride in that achievement. Our space program should be something that we ALL take part in. We shouldn‚Äôt hand over $10B in corporate welfare to Jeff Bezos or Elon Musk, who are jointly worth $350B, to fund their space hobby."
"By 2033, the United States is estimated to have a shortage of up to 139,000 physicians. That is what I mean when I say we‚Äôve got a dysfunctional health care system."
"I'm live on the floor of the Senate discussing why I support expanding U.S. production of microchips and semi-conductors but don‚Äôt support providing over $50 billion in corporate welfare to large, profitable corporations with no strings attached."
"Today, we honor George Floyd‚Äôs life and mourn with his family. One year after his murder, we remain dedicated to rooting out systemic racism and police violence against people of color, and building a nation free of oppression that respects the human dignity of every person."
Yes. Congress should work to expand U.S. microchip production. No. As part of the Endless Frontiers bill we should not be handing out $53 billion in corporate welfare to some of the largest and most profitable corporations in the country with no strings attached.
"As the latest war in Gaza was raging, I convened a small group of experts to discuss the situation and steps that must be taken to prevent future violence."
"Total student debt of 43 million Americans: $1.8 trillion

Total wealth of 719 billionaires in America: $4.56 trillion

Our job: Cancel student debt, make public colleges and universities tuition free and have the wealthy and large corporations pay their fair share of taxes."
"Unfettered capitalism is the Charles Koch family becoming $37 billion richer during a horrific pandemic while using their fortune not to alleviate homelessness or end child hunger in America, but to evict working families facing economic desperation from their homes."
Workers around the country are fighting for dignity on the job and making history. It is because of them that raising the minimum wage to a living wage is no longer a radical idea. I'm proud to stand with them ‚Äì always.
"Let us hope that the ceasefire in Gaza holds. But that's not enough. Our job now is to support desperately needed humanitarian and reconstruction aid to Gaza‚Äôs people, and find a way to finally bring peace to the region."
"To understand this war, we must understand what the Palestinian people have been enduring under blockade and occupation. I believe we must stand in solidarity with those Palestinians and Israelis working to build a future of equality and peaceful coexistence."
"Our health care system is dysfunctional in many ways, but one of the most critical is that we are facing a major doctor shortage. We're holding a hearing NOW on what Congress can do about it."
"At a moment when U.S.-made bombs are devastating Gaza, and killing women and children, we cannot simply let another huge arms sale go through without even a Congressional debate."
I'm on the Senate floor NOW calling for an immediate cease-fire in Gaza.
"If we are serious about spending taxpayer dollars wisely and effectively, we've got to end the absurdity of the Pentagon being the only agency in the federal government that has not passed an independent audit ever in the history of the country. That is the very least we cando."
"In Denmark, the average worker in McDonald's makes $22 an hour, receives 6 weeks of paid vacation, 1 year of paid family leave, life insurance and a pension. Yes. If McDonald's workers in Denmark can have a decent standard of living, we can do it in the U.S. #McDonaldsStrike"
You better believe McDonald's can afford to pay all of its workers at least $15 an hour. I'm live NOW with workers who are striking today for dignity on thejob.
"The U.S. has one of the highest rates of childhood poverty in the industrialized world. In the coming weeks, 39 million American families and 88 percent of children are going to get much needed relief in the form of monthly payments. It‚Äôs a good start, but we must do more."
"Yes. We have to think big not small. Healthcare, lifelong education, affordable housing and a clean environment are human rights.In this pivotal moment in human history, we must lead the world in a new direction."
"While Republican leaders want to deny $300 a week in unemployment benefits to working families, they had no problem introducing a bill this year to repeal the estate tax that would give a $1.7 trillion tax break to wealthy families who inherit over $1 billion. Total hypocrisy!"
"Unbelievable but true: The same Republicans who voted for trillions in tax breaks for the top 1% and large corporations, now want to increase taxes on working families through user fees, more toll roads and higher gas taxes while cutting Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid."
Let's be clear. The problem in America is not that unemployed workers are receiving an extra $300 a week in emergency benefits during a horrific pandemic. The problem is that too many employers in America are exploiting their workers by paying starvation wages with no benefits.
Republicans had no problem giving a $1.4 billion tax break to the Koch family worth $128 billion. But they just can't stand that an unemployed worker who lost a job during a pandemic is receiving an extra $300 a week in benefits to help pay the rent. Total hypocrisy!
"This is what happens when employers raise wages from $7.25 an hour to $15 an hour: A job ""shortage"" turns into a surge in job applications. It ain't complicated. There's no labor shortage in America. There's a shortage of employers willing to pay a living wage with good benefits."
"As President Biden considers his choice for Ambassador to Israel, I encourage him to choose someone who can represent our country in an even-handed way, and who can engage not only with Israel but with the Palestinians as well."
Democrats in Congress secured life-saving unemployment aid to workers so they wouldn‚Äôt have to go back to work for starvation wages or without childcare. I sent a letter to Labor Secretary Walsh today asking him to ensure Republican Governors do not strip that assistance away.
"For too long, our government has worked only for the 1%. Sen. Mitch McConnell and his Republican friends want to keep it that way. Too bad. We are going to put the needs of working people first."
"‚ÄúEvery gun that is made, every warship launched, every rocket signifies, in the final sense, a theft from those who hunger and are not fed, those who are cold and are not clothed. This world in arms is not spending money alone.‚Äù

‚Äì President Dwight D. Eisenhower"
"Rep. Liz Cheney and I disagree on nearly every major issue. But she deserves credit for saying, ""I will not sit back and watch in silence while others lead our party down a path that abandons the rule of law and joins the former president‚Äôs crusade to undermine our democracy.‚Äù"
"LIVE: The Senate Budget Committee is holding a hearing focused on waste, fraud and cost overruns at thePentagon."
"We cannot simply protect democracy. We must expand it, so that every person in America can participate in the political process."
I am extremely concerned by the growing conflict in Israel and Palestine. Once again we are seeing how the irresponsible actions of government-allied right-wing extremists in Jerusalem can escalate quickly into devastating war.
"Tomorrow, the Budget Committee, which I Chair, will be taking a hard look at waste, fraud and cost overruns at the Pentagon. Despite receiving $740 billion, the Pentagon remains the only agency in the federal government that cannot pass an independent audit. Not acceptable."
"In the richest country in the world, it is an outrage that college students struggle with hunger every day. Enough is enough. We must eradicate hunger on college campuses."
"This is a rigged economy. CEOs of companies that pay some of the lowest wages in America‚Äîoften employing essential workers‚Äîsaw their pay increase by an average of 29% in 2020. 

And the workers? A 2% decrease in pay in 2020. That is absurd."
"The original vision of Medicare was to provide quality health care coverage to our nation‚Äôs seniors. @RepJayapal and I believe we must lower the eligibility age for Medicare to at least 60 and expand benefits to include dental, vision and hearing coverage."
"Dealing with climate change now is not an ""option.""It's anecessity.If we do not lead the world in transforming our energy system away from fossil fuel, there will not only be irreparable harm to our planet but a huge economic cost.Now is the time for a Green New Deal."
"The United States must speak out strongly against the violence by government-allied Israeli extremists in East Jerusalem and the West Bank, and make clear that the evictions of Palestinian families must not go forward."
Providing an extra $300 a week in unemployment benefits to low-income families living in desperation is not radical. What's radical is that 719 billionaires became $1.6 trillion richer during the pandemic while the $7.25 federal minimum wage has not been increased in 12 years.
No. We don't need to end $300 a week in emergency unemployment benefits that workers desperately need. We need to end starvation wages in America. If $300 a week is preventing employers from hiring low-wage workers there's a simple solution: Raise your wages. Pay decent benefits.
"Mitch McConnell said that 100% of his focus is to oppose President Biden. Not 50%, not 80%, but 100%. If we're going to achieve anything meaningful for working families we must use reconciliation, abolish the filibuster and pass legislation with 51 votes. We can't afford to wait."
"Rep. Liz Cheney (R-WY) will likely be voted off the House Republican Leadership.Her crime: acknowledging the reality that Trump lost the election. The Republican Party is no longer a ""conservative"" party.It is an anti-democratic cult pushing the Big Lie and conspiracy theories."
I applaud the Biden administration for taking this bold step to speed up the production and availability of coronavirus vaccines. I also recognize the dedicated work done by activists around the world to put this issue on the global agenda. We are all in this together.
"The pharmaceutical industry could double the price of your medicine tomorrow. It is time for us to take on their greed, allow Medicare to negotiate drug prices and use the savings to cover dental, hearing aids and eye glasses."
"In this pivotal moment, if we have the courage to educate, organize and go forward, we will win this struggle. We must expand Medicare benefits and lower the age of Medicare eligibility in America."
Yes. It is time for the wealthy and large corporations to pay their fair share of taxes.
"The labor union movement has led the fight for equal rights and economic and social justice. Today, May Day, we reflect on those struggles, and pledge our support to protecting workers‚Äô rights and building an economy based on human needs, not corporate greed."
"We are BEGINNING to create an economy that works for all. But more must be done. We must raise the minimum wage to $15, provide health care for all, lower prescription drug costs, forgive student debt and demand the wealthy and large corporations pay their fair share of taxes."
"‚ÄúI want to hear. I want to see. I want to be able to eat and smile.‚Äù 

It‚Äôs time to expand Medicare to cover vision, hearing and dental care."
"Congress must finally stand up to the greed of the pharmaceutical industry. Medicare must negotiate prescription drug prices, and we must use the $450 billion in savings to expand Medicare to cover dental, hearing and vision. We must also lower Medicare age eligibility."
"Tonight, with President Biden‚Äôs speech, we begin the process of dealing with the long-term structural problems facing this country."
"Prescription drug prices:

"It‚Äôs time for Medicare to finally cover hearing, dental and vision care."
I applaud President Biden‚Äôs important action to raise the minimum wage for federal contract workers to $15 an hour. Congress should follow his lead and end starvation wages for the rest of the nation. Let‚Äôs get it done.
I sent a letter with 16 of my colleagues today asking President Biden to propose in his American Families Plan the most significant expansion of Medicare since it was signed into law to improve the lives of millions of Americans.
"We must take on the greed of the pharmaceutical industry, lower drug prices and use the savings to expand Medicare by lowering the eligibility age and providing dental, hearing and vision care to tens of millions of older Americans."
"Recognition of the Armenian genocide is long overdue, and I applaud President Biden for this announcement. It is important for all of us to look honestly at history to make sure such atrocities never happen again."
"Congratulations to the Delaware State Senate for voting to increase the state minimum wage to $15 an hour. Hopefully, Delaware's two U.S. senators will pay attention and help us raise the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour. Americans can no longer work for starvation wages."
I am once again asking President Biden to support a WTO waiver that would enable the sharing of life-saving vaccine technology with poorer countries. Join me LIVE now:
"Today with this historic vote and every day we stand in solidarity with the Asian-American community all over this country. We reject the hate and racism that‚Äôs led to an increase in anti-Asian violence, particularly against women, older people, and workers."
"Unless we take bold action to transform our energy system away from fossil fuels and take on the climate crisis, our children and grandchildren are going to look back on this period in history and ask a very simple question: ""Where were they?‚Äù"
Fossil fuel profits are not more important than our planet.
"In the wealthiest country in the history of the world, a higher education should be a right for all, not a privilege for the few. If we are going to have the kind of standard of living that the American people deserve, we need to have the best educated workforce in the world."
"The jury's verdict delivers accountability for Derek Chauvin, but not justice for George Floyd. Real justice for him and too many others can only happen when we build a nation that fundamentally respects the human dignity of every person."
"Wealthy campaign contributors gave $3.4 billion ‚Äì with a ""b"" ‚Äì to candidates and causes since 2009. That's what holds in place our rigged, corrupt economic and political systems. The time is now to get big money out of politics, and move to the public funding of elections."
"Justice for George Floyd, Adam Toledo, Daunte Wright and too many before them must include a national transformation that brings accountability for all officers who murder, including firings, criminal and civil penalties."
"At this time of unprecedented crisis, we must move forward to boldly address the systemic and existential threats facing us today and that includes combating climate change and making sure that every American has a safe and decent place to live."
Make no mistake about what is happening here: activist Aleksei Navalny is being murdered in front of the world by Vladimir Putin for the crime of exposing Putin‚Äôs vast corruption. Navalny‚Äôs doctors must be allowed to see him immediately.
"If we do not get our act together on climate change, our entire planet will face irreparable harm."
Bringing troops home from Afghanistan is a courageous decision by President Biden. There is more to be done to end the forever wars. @RepRoKhanna and I write about the next steps.
"I stand in solidarity with the University of Vermont staff who are organizing to form a union. When workers unionize and collectively bargain, they gain a strong voice to fight for better employment conditions that benefit us all."
LIVE: Some very powerful special interests tell us the cost of combatting climate change is just too expensive. Compared to what? We're holding a Budget Committee hearing NOW on the cost of inaction on climatechange.
"The Budget Committee tomorrow at 11 a.m. will hold a hearing on the cost of inaction on climate change. But it won't be Big Oil who pays the price. If we do nothing, climate change will push millions into extreme poverty, disproportionately in communities of color."
We are seeing record levels of hunger in the richest nation on earth. We cannot continue to prop up a grossly unjust economy in which the very rich get much richer while millions of working families struggle to afford the most basic necessities of life.

The U.S.-backed Saudi war in Yemen has created the world‚Äôs worst humanitarian crisis. I join with my colleagues in calling on the Biden administration to demand an end to the Saudi blockade and allow desperately needed aid into the country.
"The Republicans say that we cannot afford to invest in health care, education, housing, nutrition and the basic needs of working families. I say that we cannot afford to give trillions in tax breaks to the rich and large corporations and spend $740 billion a year on the military."

Cost of a set of dentures: Over $2,500

Cost of prescription eyeglasses: Over $200

Median income of seniors: About $2,200 a month

In the richest country on earth, we must expand Medicare to include vision, hearing and dental care."
Let's be clear: 70% of tipped workers are women. We will not have equal pay for equal work until we increase the $2.13 sub-minimum wage - which has not gone up in 30 years - to $15 an hour and adopt one fair wage. We must end the crisis of starvation wages in America.
"Lowering the Medicare eligibility age is not just the right thing to do, it's what the American people want. 

According to a recent Gallup poll:

‚Äì 65% want to reduce the Medicare age to 60

‚Äì 60% want to expand Medicare to all

Health care is a human right, not a privilege."
"In the richest country on earth it's absurd that 75% of seniors who need hearing aids don't have one, 65% of seniors don't have dental insurance &amp; eyeglass frames manufactured for as little as $10 cost over $230. We must expand Medicare to cover hearing, vision &amp; dental care."
"Maybe it's a radical idea in Washington, but no. I do not believe that the billionaire class should pay a lower effective tax rate than the middle class. A profitable corporation like Zoom should not be able to pay nothing in federal income taxes when its profits go up by 4,000%."
Life expectancy for low-income Americans is right now about 15 years lower than for the wealthy. Poverty in the richest country in the history of the world is a death sentence.
"Since 1985, the average Wall Street bonus has gone up 1,217%. If the federal minimum wage had increased at the same rate as Wall Street bonuses, it would be $44/hour. Instead, it's remained stuck at $7.25 an hour for 12 years. We must raise the minimum wage to at least $15/hour."
"There are millions of seniors who cannot afford dental care, hearing aids or eyeglasses. In the richest country on earth that is unacceptable. That is why Medicare must negotiate drug prices and use the savings to expand Medicare to cover these basic health care needs."
The United States cannot prosper and remain a vigorous democracy when so few have so much and so many have so little. We must address the crisis of income and wealth inequality now.
"The time is now to address the enormous crisis facing seniors who are unable to get the dental care, the hearing aids, and the optical care that they need."
Does anyone out there honestly believe that the answer to growing income and wealth inequality is to give more tax breaks to billionaires? That is absurd.
"No. We will not allow Trump's handpicked Postmaster General Louis DeJoy to slow down mail delivery, cut hours at post offices and sabotage the Postal Service. We will expand and strengthen it. It is way past time to fire Mr. DeJoy."

"The GOP bill to repeal the estate tax would give the Walton family, the richest family in America and the owners of Walmart, a tax break of up to $88 billion. Does anyone really believe that we should be providing an $88 billion tax break to the wealthiest family in the country?"
What do my Republican colleagues want to do to address the crises facing working families today? They want to give tax breaks to the wealthiest people in the country. That is obscene.

"Congratulations on this historic confirmation, Secretary @DebHaalandNM!"
"Amazon's Jeff Bezos won't join our hearing Wednesday on income and wealth inequality. But Jennifer Bates, who works at Mr. Bezos' warehouse in Alabama where workers are fighting to form a union, will be with us."
"One year after she was murdered by police officers, it is a disgrace that we are still waiting on justice for Breonna Taylor. Yes, her life mattered. The time is long overdue for us to combat systemic racism and a broken criminal justice system."
I'm sorry Mr. Bezos won't join our hearing on income and wealth inequality. As the wealthiest person on earth I'd love to hear his reasoning as to why he is vigorously opposing a union organizing effort at Amazon which would improve wages and benefits for struggling workers.
Today my colleagues and I sent a letter to @SecBlinken asking him to urge the Israeli government to make sure that all Palestinians in the occupied territories receive the COVID vaccine.
"In my view, we can no longer tolerate billionaires becoming obscenely rich at a time of unprecedented economic pain and suffering. The time has come to tax their wealth and break up tech giants and other huge conglomerates that have monopolized nearly every sector of our economy."
"I have invited Jeff Bezos to testify in the Budget Committee next week to explain to the American people why he thinks it's appropriate for him to spend a whole lot of money denying economic dignity to workers at Amazon, while he has become $78 billion richer during the pandemic."
I'm LIVE with @GovPhilScott to discuss how the American Rescue Plan will help working Vermonters.
"With 400,000 children now at risk of starvation in Yemen, the U.S. must tell the Saudis in no uncertain terms: immediately end the blockade and let humanitarian aid in. #YemenCantWait"
"I support the United States backing a TRIPS waiver at the WTO to ensure that life-saving COVID vaccine technology is available to all people, regardless of wealth."
"A new analysis out today shows that the American Rescue Plan will dramatically reduce poverty. That‚Äôs what happens when Congress writes legislation focused on the needs of the working class, not the wealthy and huge corporations. Not complicated!"
What‚Äôs in the covid relief legislation? Here‚Äôs a quick summary.
"Today, I am proud to join the global call for a People‚Äôs Vaccine. The United States must play a leading role in making sure a coronavirus vaccine is available to all people around the world."
"The Senate must now pass the PRO Act to strengthen unions and restore power to workers.

It was the trade union movement that built the middle class, and it will be the trade union movement that will rebuild the middle class once again."
"As President, Lula did incredible work to lower poverty in Brazil and to stand up for workers. It is great news that his highly suspect conviction has been annulled. This is an important victory for democracy and justice in Brazil."
Republicans used the budget process to give $1.9 trillion in tax breaks mostly to the top 1% and tried to throw 30 million people off their health care. We are using it to address the crises facing working families.
"Thank you to the Congressional Progressive Caucus for their extraordinary effort in passing the American Rescue Plan, which is the most significant legislation for working people in the modern history of this country. Without them, this bill is not possible."
"56 years after Bloody Sunday, we remember those who put everything on the line for democracy, equality and freedom. We must honor their legacy by passing legislation to protect and expand voting rights for generations to come."
"Today, we are beginning to restore faith in our government amongst our people. They are hurting, and we are responding."
"As Chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, I am proud that we passed the American Rescue Plan, which, in my view, is the most significant piece of legislation to benefit working families in the modern history of this country."
"It is not acceptable to me that half of our people are living paycheck to paycheck. We need an economy that works for all of us. To do that, we must increase the minimum wage to $15 an hour and give 32 million Americans a raise."
"The American people are reaching out to us. They are saying, ""we are hurting."" When people are hurting in a democratic society, government is supposed to respond to their pain. If we can't stand up for the working families that we represent, we don't deserve to be here."
"If any Senator believes this is the last time they will cast a vote on whether or not to give a raise to 32 million Americans, they are sorely mistaken. We‚Äôre going to keep bringing it up, and we‚Äôre going to get it done because it is what the American people demand and need."
"In this moment of unprecedented crises, the Senate must respond through unprecedented action. We must put the needs of working families ahead of the needs of the wealthy and powerful. That is what this reconciliation bill is all about."
"This morning, there will be a vote on the floor of the U.S. Senate to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour. As I‚Äôve said for years, it is time to end starvation wages in this country."
It is time to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour. The working class is demanding it.
70 percent of tipped workers are women. They suffer from the highest rates of sexual harassment of workers in any industry. The time is NOW to end the tipped minimum wage of $2.13 an hour.
This shows the contempt Republicans have for the needs of working class Americans.
I'd love to hear anyone in the Congress tell me they can live on $7.25 an hour. Guess what? They can't! It is time to raise the minimum wage to a living wage of $15 an hour.
I'm on the Senate floor NOW talking about why it's time to eliminate the tipped minimum wage of $2.13 an hour.
"If we are serious about calling ourselves a democracy, we need to end voter suppression and make it easier for people to vote. I applaud the House of Representatives for passing this legislation. The Senate must move quickly to take it up and passit."
Raising the minimum wage is not just about economic justice ‚Äì it is also about racial justice and gender equality. Black and Hispanic women are more than twice as likely as White men to make less than $15 an hour. We must end starvation wages in America.
"It is outrageous that, amid a global pandemic, major pharmaceutical companies are lobbying to protect billions in profits. I urge the Biden administration to support the proposal to waive vaccine-related IP rights at the WTO to rapidly expand supplies ofvaccines."
"As soon as tomorrow, I will introduce an amendment on the floor of the U.S. Senate to end starvation wages in America. No one can survive on $7.25 an hour."
"Happy Town Meeting Day, Vermont. While our tradition looks different this year, Vermont remains an example to the rest of the nation. If we want a strong democracy, we must make voting easier ‚Äì not harder."
"What workers at the Amazon warehouse in Bessemer, Alabama are trying to do is historic. If they win and form a union, it will send a shockwave throughout our country."
"This week, as part of the reconciliation bill, I will be offering an amendment to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour."
I applaud the Israeli health officials for their efforts. Making sure all Palestinians receive vaccines is the right thing to do from both a public health and moral perspective. I hope the Israeli government follows their advice as quickly as possible.
"If Amazon workers in Alabama ‚Äì a strong anti-union state ‚Äì vote to form a union, it'll be a shot heard around the world. If they can negotiate higher wages &amp; better working conditions in the South, it'll benefit every worker in America. Thank you, Mr. President, for speaking out."
"While Walmart refuses to raise its $11 minimum wage, Alice Walton had no problem purchasing a $500 million private art collection, buying a $25 million 2-floor Park Avenue condo with 52 windows and acquiring a $22 million 4,400-acre Texas ranch. Something is very wrong here."
"The Walton family is, I think, the poster child for greed."
"The most distressing aspect of our current economy is that half of our people are living paycheck to paycheck. When you‚Äôre working on starvation wages, it doesn‚Äôt take much to put you in serious financial trouble. We‚Äôve got to take care of low-income workers in this country."
"If Rob Walton, a key owner of Walmart, can afford an estimated $226 million for an antique car collection that includes 12 Ferraris, 6 Porsches, 2 Maseratis and a 1963 Corvette Grand Sport Roadster, you know what? Walmart can afford to pay at least $15/hour to all of its workers."
"Fancy cars. Expensive art. Huge houses. The Waltons ‚Äì the wealthiest family in the country ‚Äì spend millions on themselves, but refuse to pay their workers a living wage."
"I am very concerned by last night‚Äôs strike by U.S. forces in Syria. The president has the responsibility to keep Americans safe, but for too long administrations of both parties have interpreted their authorities in an extremely expansive way to continue war. This must end."
It is time for the owners of the nation‚Äôs most profitable corporations to pay their workers a living wage. That isn‚Äôt a radical idea in the richest country in the history of the world.
I strongly disagree with tonight‚Äôs decision by the Senate Parliamentarian. But the fight to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour continues.
"Today, I asked the CEOs of Walmart and McDonald's a simple question: Why should taxpayers subsidize the starvation wages of their profitable corporations. If they think they can avoid answering this question because they declined to testify at my hearing they are sorely mistaken."
"Taxpayers should not subsidize starvation wages paid by the largest and most profitable corporations in America. We must raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour. It‚Äôs morally right, and good for the economy."
The Budget Committee is this morning holding a hearing on a simple question: Why should the taxpayers of this country subsidize starvation wages at some of the largest and most profitable corporations in America?
The family that owns Walmart is worth more than $200 billion. The CEO of McDonalds received $18 million in compensation in 2019. Are we really supposed to believe they can‚Äôt afford to pay their workers $15 an hour? Absurd.
"We must have the guts to stand up to special interests, and fight for the working class of this country."
"As the occupying power, Israel is responsible for the health of all the people under its control. It is outrageous that Netanyahu would use spare vaccines to reward his foreign allies while so many Palestinians in the occupied territories are still waiting."
"This initiative from the Biden administration to give Americans high-quality, reusable masks without cost at community health centers, food pantries and soup kitchens will save tens of thousands of lives ‚Äìperiod."
You cannot tell me that raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour is a radical idea.
"Working people in this country are living in great desperation, so of course selfish billionaires are buying ads to try and stop the relief bill. Sorry, Charles Koch. We‚Äôre going to pass this legislation, and then we‚Äôll make sure you pay your fair share in taxes."
Fast food workers built a grassroots movement to raise the minimum wage to a living wage of $15 an hour. Congress must now stand with them and take action. Working people must be able to live with dignity in the richest country in the world.
"While the very rich get richer, working class families today are facing economic devastation. Yes. We need to increase direct payment to $2000 for workers and their kids; raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour; expand the child tax credit and extend unemployment benefits."
Half of our workers are living paycheck to paycheck and millions of people are working for starvation wages. We need the minimum wage to be a living wage and that‚Äôs why we‚Äôre going to raise it to $15 an hour.
"Walmart &amp; McDonald's pay wages so low that tens of thousands of their workers are forced to rely on food stamps, Medicaid &amp; public housing. I invited the CEOs of these companies to a hearing to explain why they can't afford to pay a $15 minimum wage. Taxpayers deserve an answer."
"It is a moral outrage that the wealthiest family in America, the Walton family, still refuses to pay workers at Walmart at least $15 an hour. Over the past 3 years, the Walton family became $84 billion richer, while Walmart's minimum wage has remained stuck at $11. Unacceptable."
"There is no rational reason why Medicare pays nearly three times more than Medicaid and about twice as much as the VA for the same exact medicine, but that‚Äôs exactly what the CBO just found. 

Congress must end this national embarrassment."
".@RevDrBarber, AFL-CIO President @RichardTrumka, and SEIU President @MaryKayHenry are exactly right. We must end starvation wages and give 32 million Americans a raise by increasing the minimum wage to $15 an hour."
"Developed nations with the best healthcare, family leave, vacation &amp; retirement benefits:

1. Denmark
2. The Netherlands
3. Finland
4. Sweden
5. Switzerland
6. Norway
7. Germany
8. UK
9. Canada
10. Japan

30. United States - Dead last

We must end this international embarrassment"
That's great news. We need an Interior Secretary who has the guts to take on fossil fuel CEOs whose greed is destroying the planet. We need an Interior Secretary who will protect our environment. I'm confident Deb Haaland is that person and I am proud to support her nomination.
"A $15 minimum wage is not a radical idea. What's radical is the fact that millions of Americans are forced to work for starvation wages, while 650 billionaires became over $1 trillion richer during a global pandemic. Yes. We must raise the minimum wage to a living wage."
"It is truly sad and dangerous that only 7 Republicans voted to convict a president who is promoting a Big Lie, conspiracy theories and violence, and is aggressively trying to destroy American democracy."
Pathetic. Trump‚Äôs attorneys still will not acknowledge that Trump lost the election. That‚Äôs what the Big Lie is all about.
"Major League Baseball‚Äôs announcement to eliminate the Vermont Lake Monsters and 39 other Minor League teams has everything to do with greed.

If Major League Baseball does not reconsider this proposal, I think it‚Äôs time for Congress to rescind the huge tax breaks it has received."
"History must record that this Congress made it clear that no president can incite his followers into insurrection. This was an outrageous attack on the democratic foundations of which this country is built.

Trump must be impeached and convicted."
"Do not tell me a $15-an-hour living wage is a ""radical"" idea. It has 66% support in Democratic districts. It has 59% support in Republican districts.

Giving 32 million workers a raise is not a partisan issue‚Äîit is common sense. Now let's get it done."
"Telling a worker making $52,000 a year that they're ""too rich"" to get the full $2,000 in direct relief is totally absurd.

We made promises to the American people that we would help our working families‚Äîand those promises have got to be kept."
The CBO has demonstrated that increasing the minimum wage would have a direct and substantial impact on the federal budget. What that means is that we can clearly raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour under the rules of budget reconciliation.
"I strongly oppose lowering income eligibility for direct payments from $75,000 to $50,000 for individuals and $150,000 to $100,000 for couples.  In these difficult times, ALL working class people deserve the full $1,400.  Last I heard, someone making $55,000 a year is not ""rich."""
My message to Jeff Bezos and Amazon is clear: These despicable anti-union tactics must stop. Every worker in this country has the right to join a union. Period.
"Now is the time to raise the minimum wage to $15, pull millions out of poverty, and provide small-business support to make it happen.

Yes. The Democratic Congress can and must fulfill President Biden's promise to the American people.

Let's get it done."
"Today, with the passage of this budget resolution to provide relief to our working families, we have the opportunity not only to address the pandemic and the economic collapse‚Äîwe have the opportunity to give hope to the American people and restore faith in our government."
"If Republicans want to work with us to address this unprecedented economic crisis, welcome‚Äîlet‚Äôs do it.

But we cannot wait weeks and weeks, and months and months, to provide relief to the American people.

We have got to act now, and that‚Äôs exactly what we‚Äôre doing."
"Instead of listening to the billionaire class, now is the time for the Senate to listen to the needs of working families, the elderly, the sick, the disabled, and the poor.
 
Let us pass this Budget Resolution to provide the relief Americans need."
"Today's announcement that the White House will end military support for the Saudi-led war in the Yemen war is a tribute to the work of so many activists over the years.

Yemen needs food, medicine, and health care‚Äînot bombs and blockades."
"We are living in an unprecedented moment in history. 

Now is the time to restore faith that the American government works for all of us, not just those at thetop."
"It is no secret millions of Americans have given up on democracy. They think that we don‚Äôt care about working people.

This week, we not only begin addressing the health and economic crises we face, but‚Äîmaybe even more importantly‚Äîwe begin restoring faith in the U.S. government."
"If Republicans could use budget reconciliation to help the wealthy and the powerful, and pass legislation strongly opposed by the American people, we can use that same process to help Americans recover from the worst economic and public health crisis in modern history."
"For the second weekend in a row, thousands of brave Russians took to the streets to protest the corrupt rule of Putin and his thieving oligarchs. Unjustly imprisoned activists, including Alexei Navalny, must be released."
"At a time of massive crises facing working families, my Republican colleagues have suddenly become very concerned about the deficit. That's funny. I didn't hear these concerns when they passed trillions in tax breaks for the rich &amp; a blank check for endless wars. What hypocrisy!"
"McDonald‚Äôs worker in the US: $9/hr

McDonald‚Äôs worker in Denmark: $22/hr, 6 weeks of annual vacation, a union, 1 year of paid family leave, life insurance and pension.

America must join the rest of the industrialized world and ensure that our working class can live with dignity."
Wall Street cannot continue functioning as a gambling casino. It's time for a tax on Wall Street speculation so that we can raise the funds to cancel student debt and make public colleges and universities tuition-free.
The business model of Wall Street is fraud.
"Minimum wage in 1968 (in today's dollars): $11.84

Federal minimum wage in 2021: $7.25

Please do not tell me that in the richest country on Earth, we cannot guarantee a living wage of at least $15 an hour to every worker in America."
This is very good news. @JoeBiden is moving quickly to address the climate crisis. Now Congress needs to aggressively act to transition our energy system away from fossil fuels.
"Today, on Holocaust Remembrance Day, we pledge to never forget the 6 million Jews murdered by the Nazis. At a time of rising antisemitism, racism, and xenophobia, we must recommit ourselves to fight against all forms of bigotry and intolerance."
"With Democratic control of the House, the Senate, and the White House, we must keep our promise to the American people and finally raise a $7.25 starvation wage to a $15-an-hour living wage.

The American people need a raise, and they need it NOW."
"Terrence Wise is 39 years old, works two jobs at Burger King and McDonald‚Äôs, and still has had to deal with homelessness.

In the richest country on Earth, that is immoral.

Nobody in America can survive on $7.25 an hour. All of our workers must earn at least a $15 living wage."
"Today, I am introducing the Raise the Wage Act with my colleagues to raise the minimum wage to $15/hour. 

The time for talk is over. No more excuses. We can no longer tolerate millions of workers making starvation wages.

Watch our press conference here:"
What concerns me as much as anything is that half our people are living paycheck to paycheck. Millions of people are trying to survive on starvation wages. It‚Äôs morally imperative that we raise the minimum wage to a living wage that‚Äôs at least $15 an hour.
"Minimum wage in Australia: $19.84 an hour
Unemployment rate in Australia: 6.6%

U.S. federal minimum wage: $7.25 an hour
U.S. unemployment rate: 6.7%

Please don't tell me raising the minimum wage to a living wage - at least $15 an hour - costs jobs."
"‚ÄúCall it democracy, or call it democratic socialism, but there must be a better distribution of wealth within this country for all of God's children.‚Äù ‚Äî Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr."
"Not long ago, people said a $15 minimum wage was unthinkable. But a grassroots movement refused to take no for an answer.

Today, the President's order begins raising the minimum wage to $15/hour for federal contractors.

Now, Congress must pass a $15 living wage for ALL workers."
Rob Malley is an extremely knowledgeable expert with great experience in promoting U.S. security through diplomacy rather than war. He would be an excellent choice for the role of Iran envoy.
Republicans have used reconciliation for oil drilling in the arctic refuge and to pass trillions in tax breaks for the wealthy and the powerful by a simple majority vote. We can and we must do the same to raise the minimum wage to at least $15 an hour.
"I don't know what ""meeting in the middle"" means when scientists say we only have a few years to address climate change or face irreparable harm.
 
Of course I want to work with Republicans‚Äîbut we have got to aggressively respond to the enormous crises facing working families."
"I welcome these remarks from Secretary-Designate Blinken.

Congress must work in a bipartisan way with the new administration to finally end the horrific war in Yemen, and ensure that no president can ever again engage in unconstitutional wars."
"When the GOP controlled the Senate, they passed trillions in tax breaks largely to the top 1% and multinational corporations by a simple majority vote through reconciliation.

We must use the same process to protect working families, the sick and the poor."
"The monthly price of:

Insulin:
$373 in the U.S.
$47 in France

Januvia for diabetes:
$331 in the U.S.
$39 in Germany

Advair for asthma:
$310 in the U.S.
$29 in Australia

Our job: End the greed, collusion and price-fixing of the pharmaceutical industry and lower drug prices."
"Wealth increase in past 10 months:
‚¨ÜÔ∏è$173 billion: Elon Musk
‚¨ÜÔ∏è$77 billion: Jeff Bezos
‚¨ÜÔ∏è$60 billion: Walton family
‚¨ÜÔ∏è$43 billion: Bill Gates
‚¨ÜÔ∏è$39 billion: Mark Zuckerberg

12-year increase in U.S. minimum wage: $0

We must tax the rich &amp; raise the minimum wage to at least $15."
"Amidst massive income and wealth inequality tens of millions of Americans are working for starvation wages. We need to raise the minimum wage to a living wage, at least $15 an hour. No more excuses. We need to act NOW."
"‚ÄúWe now have the resources, we now have the skills, we now have the techniques to get rid of poverty. And the question is whether our nation has the will.‚Äù ‚Äî Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr."
"After surviving an attempt on his life, Russian activist Alexei Navalny has been detained after bravely returning to Russia today. I call for his release.

The United States must stand with those fighting corruption and working for democracy around the world."
"President-Elect Biden's COVID rescue plan will begin to provide our people with much-needed support, such as $2,000 direct payments and a $15 minimum wage.

I look forward to working with him and my colleagues in Congress to urgently provide bold relief to working families."
"Veterans Affairs' single-payer program pays half as much as Medicare for the exact same drugs.

There's absolutely no reason for this‚Äîother than greed.

Congress must take on the pharmaceutical industry and make Medicare negotiate lower drug prices NOW."
"No mother should have to go through this.

A vial of insulin costs about $5 to make. Yet people with diabetes are dying because drug companies charge as much as $540 per vial in the U.S."
"In the past, Republicans used budget reconciliation to pass massive tax breaks for the rich and large corporations with a simple majority vote.

As the incoming Chairman of the Budget Committee, I will fight to use the same process to boldly address the needs of working families."
"If Wall Street really believed in defending our democracy, they would commit to never making another campaign donation‚Äîperiod."
The death penalty is cruel and unusal punishment. It must be abolished.
"Wealth of Elon Musk on March 18, 2020: $24.5 billion
Wealth of Elon Musk on January 9, 2021: $209 billion

U.S. minimum wage in 2009: $7.25 an hour
U.S. minimum wage in 2021: $7.25 an hour

Our job: Raise the minimum wage to at least $15, tax the rich &amp; create an economy for all."
"140,000 workers lost their jobs last month &amp; real unemployment is close to 12%. Millions more face hunger, eviction &amp; crushing debt. In the midst of this economic desperation, Congress must act boldly &amp; aggressively. As the next Budget Committee Chair, that's what I intend to do."
"It is an outrage that over 1 million workers who lost jobs during the pandemic haven't received the benefits they earned and deserve. We must make it easier, not harder, for workers to receive these benefits. And, yes, the working class needs $2,000 a month until the crisis ends."
"No, Donald Trump, there are no votes for you to find. The American people have spoken and at 12:01 pm on January 20, you will no longer be president."
"Joe Biden will be President at noon on January 20. Republican attempts to overturn the election only demonstrate their disdain for voters, democracy and the will of the American people."
"Over the past four days, I have asked‚Äîtime and again‚Äîfor a vote on $2,000 payments that Trump, Biden, two-thirds of the House (including 44 Republicans), and 78% of the public support. Tragically, Republican leadership has turned its back on the working families of this country."
"Republicans think I don‚Äôt do much for them, but I‚Äôm trying to bring Mitch McConnell‚Äôs bill to the floor! All I ask is we also vote on the House-passed bill for $2,000 survival checks.

It‚Äôs hard for me to understand why Republicans would object to voting on a Republican bill."
"Amazon made $10.8 billion in profits, didn't pay a dime in federal taxes, and got a $129 million check from the IRS‚Äîcourtesy of Mitch McConnell and the Republican Senate.

But as our people suffer, a $2,000 check to the working class is ""socialism for the rich""? Give me a break."
"I am on the Senate floor with a compromise: Let us vote on both $2,000 survival checks and McConnell's alternative, and see where the chips fall.

Working families need help NOW. Let us not go home until the American people see their Senators vote!"
"Today, I will ask that the Senate vote yes or no on two bills: 

1. The House passed $2,000 survival checks 
2. Mitch McConnell‚Äôs alternative bill

What objection could he possibly have to voting on his own bill? Let the Senate vote on $2,000 checks, Mitch!"
"I‚Äôm delighted that Mitch McConnell suddenly decided to care about ‚Äúsocialism for the rich‚Äù! That means the huge tax breaks for billionaires that he helped pass‚Äînot the $2,000 direct payments that America‚Äôs struggling working-class families desperately need."
"Mitch McConnell says $2,000 checks are ""socialism for the rich."" Ha!

Here are the tax rebate checks corporations received from Trump's tax plan: 

Amazon: $129 million
Delta: $187 million
Chevron: $181 million
GM: $104 million
IBM: $342 million

That's socialism for the rich!"
"I am once again asking for a yes-or-no vote on $2,000 survival checks."
"All of a sudden, Mitch McConnell is ""worried"" about giving a $2,000 check to someone who ""doesn't need it.""

That's funny. He had no problem giving a $560 million tax break to Sheldon Adelson who is worth $34.3 billion. Total hypocrisy! Let the Senate vote on $2,000 now, Mitch!"
"I'm trying to figure out what the problem is with voting up or down on $2,000 direct payments to working people. Senate Republicans can't seem to give me a clearanswer."
"Bring the $2,000 checks up for a vote, Mitch. That's what democracy is about. That's what the American people want."
"We are at a historic moment. Do we turn our backs on working families who are hurting like they have never hurt before? Or do we provide them with the help they need?

Mitch McConnell and Senate Republicans are turning their backs. Enough! Let the Senate vote on $2,000 checks!"
"Today @SenMarkey and I demanded a vote on $2,000 for working people. It‚Äôs simple‚Äîno vote, no new year's break for Senators."
"Today, I will be going to the floor of the Senate to demand that the Senate pass a $2,000 direct payment to every working class American in this country. What would a $2,000 direct payment mean to you?"
"Two-thirds of the House voted to provide $2,000 in direct payments to the working class. Now it‚Äôs the Senate‚Äôs turn to do that‚Äîno excuses.

Unless McConnell agrees to a vote on $2,000 relief checks, Congress will be spending New Year‚Äôs Eve in the Capitol."
"84% of Democrats want the Senate to pass a $2,000 direct payment

73% of Republicans want the Senate to pass a $2,000 direct payment

74% of Independents want the Senate to pass a $2,000 direct payment

The House approved a $2,000 direct payment

Let the Senate vote, Mitch!"
"The House passed a $2,000 direct payment for working people. Now it's the Senate's turn. If McConnell doesn't agree to an up or down vote to provide the working people of our country a $2,000 direct payment, Congress will not be going home for New Year's Eve. Let's do our job."
"Finally. Now, Trump must get Mitch McConnell and his Republican friends in the Senate to pass legislation to provide $2,000 in direct payments to the working class‚Äî legislation I introduced with @SenKamalaHarris and @SenMarkey 7 months ago."
"If Trump refuses to sign the COVID-relief bill:

-14 million will lose unemployment benefits
-The government will shutdown on Tuesday
-The eviction moratorium will end on New Year's Eve

Mr. President: Sign this bill NOW &amp; get the Republican Senate to pass $2,000 in direct relief"
"Let's be clear:

The top 1% &amp; large corporations did NOT need a $1 trillion tax break.

The U.S. did NOT need to spend $6 trillion on endless wars.

The billionaire class does NOT need to pay a lower tax rate than the bottom 90%.

The working class NEEDS a $2,000 survival check."
"14 million Americans will lose their unemployment benefits if Trump does not sign Covid relief legislation today.

Mr. President: Stop playing golf and sign this bill NOW! And tell Mitch McConnell to pass legislation to provide $2,000 direct payments to the working class."
"Jane and I wish you a safe and merry Christmas, and happy holidays. This has been an enormously difficult year for far too many. As we head into the new year, let us rededicate ourselves to building a world of peace, justice and compassion for all."
"People who deserve pardons: 450,000 non-violent drug offenders.

People who don't deserve pardons: Paul Manafort, Roger Stone, Charles Kushner, Duncan Hunter, Joe Arpaio &amp; the Blackwater guards who massacred civilians in Iraq.

Yes. Trump is the most corrupt president in history."
"Republicans in Washington are happy to cheer on Trump's bogus conspiracy theories on non-existent election fraud, but refuse to support him when it comes to providing a $2,000 direct payment to working class Americans facing economic desperation. Pathetic."
"Hey, Senator McConnell. The ball's in your court. Schumer, Pelosi and Trump all want us to pass a $2,000 direct payment for working-class Americans who are facing more economic desperation than at any time since the Great Depression. Leader McConnell, let the Senate vote!"
"Jeff Bezos, the wealthiest man alive, became $83 billion richer over the past 9 months while Amazon made record profits. Meanwhile, Amazon workers are risking their lives to fill holiday orders and are denied paid sick leave and hazard pay. This ugly corporate greed must end."
"JPMorgan Chase illegally charged 170,000 of their customers with bogus overdraft fees and regulators let them off the hook‚Äî no fine, no sanctions, no nothing. No. The government does not regulate Wall Street. The truth is Wall Street regulates the government. That must change."
"That's funny. I didn't hear Sen. Paul worry about the deficit when he voted to give $1 trillion in tax breaks to the top 1% &amp; large corporations. Yes. We should provide the working class with $2,000 a month during the pandemic like Canada did &amp; repeal the tax breaks for the rich."
"Over the last few weeks, I have worked very hard to provide direct payments to working families across America.

While we did not get as much as we wanted, the average family of four will receive a direct payment of $2400.

In this horrific crisis, we must fight for morerelief."
"While the GOP prevented adequate financial relief to working families, they did get:

-$120 billion tax break for business owners in the 1%
-$6.3 billion tax break for a 3-martini lunch
-$4.2 billion tax break for offshore tax scams
-$2 billion for the space force

Pathetic."
"This Covid relief bill is a step forward. The average family of four will receive $2400 under this bill.

Will that help? Yes, it will. Is it enough? No, it is not. Under the Biden administration, we will continue to work hard and see our people through this crisis."
Even the Congressional Budget Office run by the Republicans concluded that Medicare for All would provide universal health care to everyone in America and cost $650 billion LESS than our current dysfunctional health care system each and every year. Yes. We need #MedicareForAll.
"The COVID-relief bill that Congress will vote on today will help many, but goes nowhere near far enough. The Biden Administration, on day 1, must bring forth a major economic relief bill that addresses the severe economic pain of working families‚Äî including more direct payments."
"During the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression, there should NOT be a tradeoff between survival checks that the working class, seniors, children &amp; the disabled desperately need and emergency unemployment benefits. In the richest country in the world, we must do both."
"Over the past 9 months, 651 billionaires in America became over $1 trillion richer.
 
During the same time, the working class, the elderly and the disabled were told to survive on just a $1,200 check.
 
$1 trillion for billionaires. One $1,200 check for the rest. That is immoral."
"I told my Senate colleagues loudly and clearly: Congress should be working 24 hours, 7 days a week until we pass a bill that addresses the pain and anxiety of millions of families throughout this country. Period."
"I am on the floor urging the Senate to provide $1,200 direct payments to all working-class Americans and $500 to their kids.

Millions are out of work, hungry, and can‚Äôt pay rent. The American people need their government to step up and pass this relief."
"At a time when tens of millions of American workers are struggling economically, I will be going to the Senate floor at 4PM today to ask unanimous consent for my legislation to provide a direct payment of $1,200 for all working-class Americans and $500 for their children."
"Until recently, there was no direct relief being considered for desperate, hungry people facing eviction.

What I have fought for‚Äîwith progressives and conservatives‚Äîis direct payments to the working class.

We are making progress in Congress, but we must go much further."
I am on the Senate floor to say clearly: America's working class is in the worst financial shape since the Great Depression. We must fight for a COVID-19 package that provides real relief for working families.
"Over 60 grassroots organizations representing millions of people are demanding Congress provide $1,200 direct payments to working-class adults and $500 to kids.

It is time for Congress to listen to the will of the people and pass relief for working families."
"Congress can't go home for the Christmas holidays until we pass legislation which provides a $1,200 direct payment to working class adults, $2,400 for couples and $500 for kids. This is what Democrats &amp; Republicans did in March through the CARES Act. It's what we must do today."
"The most effective way to keep Americans out of poverty is providing every working-class adult $1,200 and $500 for their kids.

75% of Americans want Congress to prioritize these payments in COVID-19 relief‚Äîfar above everything else. Congressional leadership must listen to them."
"Congress should be working 24 hours, 7 days a week until we pass a bill that provides emergency assistance to the American people in their time of need.

That bill must include $1,200 direct payments to working-class individuals, $2,400 for couples and $500 for kids."
"I introduced an amendment with @HawleyMO that would provide a direct payment of $1,200 for working-class individuals, $2,400 for couples and $500 for kids.

If that amendment was signed into law, what would it mean for you and your family?"
"Members of Congress cannot go back to our families for the holidays when children in the richest country on Earth are going hungry and millions are scared to death of eviction.

We must pass my amendment with @HawleyMO to get $1,200 direct checks to the working class of America."
Yes. We must abolish the death penalty‚Äî period.
"These are very, very difficult times for working families.

I want to thank all of you for your help in getting Congress to support my bipartisan amendment to provide every working-class adult with $1,200, and $500 for their kids.

Congress cannot leave without doing that."
"I am on the Senate floor to introduce a bipartisan amendment to provide $1,200 in direct payments to working-class adults and $500 to each of their kids. In the midst of this pandemic, Congress cannot go on recess without providing this relief."
"Yesterday alone, over 3,000 died from this horrific virus.

The working class of this country is in the worst financial shape since the Great Depression of the 1930s.

The American people need help and they need help NOW!"
"I am going to the Senate floor to vote AGAINST Trump‚Äôs huge arms sale to the United Arab Emirates.

The United States should be working to deescalate conflict in the Middle East, not fueling it by selling more and more weapons to regimes using them to kill civilians."
"With so many people facing economic desperation, Congress cannot recess until we pass a COVID-19 relief bill that includes at least $1,200 in direct payments for adults, $500 for kids, expanded unemployment benefits and emergency aid for states and cities to prevent mass layoffs."
"Here in Washington when we go to war: there's endless amounts of money 

Tax breaks for billionaires: endless amounts of money

Corporate welfare: endless amounts of money 

But when children are going hungry in America today, suddenly we don't have enough money. That's wrong."
"The American people need help and they need help now. That means any COVID-19 relief deal must include:

-$1,200 direct payments to the working class 
-No get-out-of-jail free card to corporations that put the lives of their workers and customers at risk"
"The $1,200 direct payments to working class adults and $500 for children passed in March kept 3.3 million Americans out of poverty.

Today, 1 in 4 workers are unemployed or make less than $20,000. Congress must provide direct payments to the working class NOW! At least $1,200."

"In the midst of the pandemic, the economic collapse and climate change, Medicare for All, a $15 minimum wage, the Green New Deal, canceling student debt and taxing billionaires are not radical ideas.

The entire process to confirm Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court is illegitimate."

"Maybe‚Äîjust maybe‚Äîthe most essential people in our economy are not hedge fund managers.

The last thing the Senate should be doing right now is considering an extreme right-wing Supreme Court nominee who would strip health care benefits from over 20 million Americans and take away protections for preexisting conditions. No confirmation until after inauguration.
"The working class of this country is hurting. 840,000 Americans filed for unemployment last week, bringing the total number of new claims to 63.6 million since mid-March. The American people need a jobs program NOW, not another right-wing Supreme Court justice."
The only thing the Senate should be doing right now is voting on a stimulus package to provide immediate economic relief to working class Americans‚Äî not ramming through a Supreme Court nominee who will strip health care from 20 million Americans in the middle of a pandemic.

"Please don't tell me we can't afford to cancel student debt, make public colleges tuition-free or expand Social Security while billionaires like Donald Trump and corporations like Amazon pay nothing or next to nothing in taxes year after year."
"Are you ready for a radical idea? Billionaires in the United States should not be paying less in taxes than nurses, teachers, firefighters and truck drivers.

It's time to tax the $845 billion in wealth gains 643 billionaires made during the pandemic and expand Medicare to all."
"The average registered nurse paid $11,526 in federal income taxes, while Donald Trump, the self-proclaimed billionaire, paid just $750. No. Paying less in taxes than working class Americans doesn't make Trump ""smart."" It makes him a bad businessman or a tax cheat‚Äî likely both."
"Federal income taxes paid in 2017:

$11,526: Avg Registered Nurse
$8,399: Avg Middle School Teacher
$6,121: Avg Firefighter
$4,649: Avg Truck Driver
$4,133: Avg Secretary
$3,807: Avg Construction Worker

$750: Self-proclaimed billionaire Donald Trump

Yes. The tax code is rigged."
"While millionaires and billionaires own 79.2% of all wealth in our country, the bottom half of Americans own just 1.5% of our nation's wealth.

Justice Brandeis was right: ""We can have democracy, or we may have wealth concentrated in the hands of a few, but we can't have both."""
"Yes. Trump's not alone.

Federal income taxes paid by corporations a year after his tax plan was signed into law:

$0: Amazon
$0: GM 
$0: Netflix
$0: Chevron
$0: FedEx
$0: Eli Lilly
$0: Starbucks

Dr. King was right. We have socialism for the rich, rugged capitalism for the rest."
"Trump's not alone. Over a three-year period, the top 1% avoided $800 billion in taxes. That's enough to:

üéìMake public colleges tuition-free
üë©‚Äçüë¶‚Äçüë¶Eliminate child hunger
üö∞Provide clean drinking water to all
üè°End homelessness

Yes. The 1% have got to pay their fair share of taxes."
"After mismanaging a deadly pandemic, Trump and Senate Republicans now want to ram through a Supreme Court nominee who will vote to destroy the Affordable Care Act, kick millions off their health care, and eliminate protections for preexisting conditions.

An absolute outrage."
"It's been 4,076 days since the federal minimum wage was last raised from $6.55 an hour to $7.25 an hour.

During that same time period, billionaires have seen their wealth go up by more than $2,500,000,000,000.

Our job: Increase the minimum wage to $15 an hour and tax the rich."
"In the wealthiest nation in the history of the world, hunger is a political choice. While Senate Republicans believe we can't afford to help millions of American families struggling to put food on the table, they had no problem providing a trillion-dollar tax break to the rich."
"Here's what Senate Republicans said when they blocked President Obama's Supreme Court nominee. Do they have any integrity?

The right thing to do for this vacancy is clear, and Senate Republicans know it. They've stated it clearer than I could."

"The U.S.-funded Organization of American States falsely claimed that last year's elections in Bolivia were ‚Äúfraudulent.‚Äù A military coup and repression followed.
 
We need real accountability NOW to ensure free and fair elections in Bolivia next month."
Yes. Abortion is a constitutional right‚Äî period.
"While Trump believes we can't afford to extend $600 a week to 30 million unemployed workers, he had no problem giving a $688 million bailout to defense contractors like Rolls-Royce not to build more masks and more gowns, but to build more warships and more drones. How Pathetic."
"Trump downplayed the threat of coronavirus for political gain. He told the American people this deadly virus would disappear.

As a result of his lies and rejection of science, 200,000 people in this country have died."
"No more private prisons and private detention centers. No more profiteering from locking people up. No more ""war on drugs."" No more keeping people in jail because they're too poor to afford cash bail. Instead of more jails and incarceration, we need more jobs and education."
"Now, more than ever, we must make it clear that women in America have a fundamental right to control their own bodies, not the government. And we must do everything we can to expand that right‚Äînot take it away, not weaken it."
"Money laundering. Bribery. Mortgage fraud. Collusion. Currency manipulation. Rate tampering.

We are the richest country in the world. We must fight to ensure that all our people live with dignity."
No worker should be paid less than the minimum wage. It's time to end the subminimum wage and guarantee truly integrated employment opportunities for people with disabilities. I'm proud that my home state of Vermont has been a leader on this issue.
"Unfortunately, Sen. McConnell has decided to go against Justice Ginsburg's dying wishes and is cementing a shameful legacy of brazen hypocrisy.

The right thing to do here is clear, and Senate Republicans know it. We should let voters decide. Period."
Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg was one of the great justices in modern American history and her passing is a tremendous loss to our country. She will be remembered as an extraordinary champion of justice and equal rights.
"$4.9 billion: The cost of preventing 30 million people worldwide from starving to death

No. The billionaire class cannot have it all while millions suffer. #TaxTheRich"
"Every week during the pandemic:

643 billionaires became $32 billion richer.

The total income of the bottom 82% of workers went down by $3.7 million - combined.

Our job: Tax the obscene wealth gains billionaires made during the pandemic and expand Medicare to all."
"While big banks and large corporations are able to borrow money for virtually no interest, it is absolutely unacceptable that low-income Americans are being charged 400% interest on a $375 payday loan. We need to put predatory lenders out of business and move to postal banking."
"Join me and @GillibrandNY as we introduce the Postal Banking Act. Together, we will guarantee basic banking services to all‚Äîno outrageous fees or interest rates‚Äîall at your local postoffice."
"$4.7 billion a day.

$32 billion a week.

$141 billion a month.

That's how much 643 billionaires in America made during the pandemic, while 30 million Americans don't have enough food to eat. Yes. It's time for austerity for the billionaire class."
"What would it mean for you to get a bank account, a small loan, a debit card or check cashing‚Äîall at your local post office?

At 2:30PM ET, @SenGillibrand and I will discuss our Postal Banking Act to provide all Americans with basic banking services. Ask us your questions below."
"Amount of federal government subsidies given to the fossil fuel industry every year: $15 billion.

The amount it should be, immediately: $0.

It's time to end fossil fuel subsidies and enact the Green New Deal."
"If we can afford to give $740 billion to the Pentagon, please don‚Äôt tell me we can‚Äôt afford to eliminate homelessness in America and cancel the rent during a pandemic. Instead of more bombs and more missiles, we need more jobs, more rent relief and more affordable housing."
"We cannot stand by as conspiracy theories about mail-in ballots and disinformation about Election Day results undermine public trust in the voting process.

The Senate must act immediately to ensure the security of our elections."
"We must reassure the American people that vote-by-mail is safe, every ballot will be counted, and our election will be free and fair.

@SenSchumer and I are calling on Sen. McConnell to act in a bipartisan way to restore public confidence in our democracy."
"Wealth and income inequality is now so extreme that the top 1% is literally taking $2.5 trillion away from the bottom 90% each and every year. It's time to end trickle-down economics, raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour and create an economy that works for all, not just the 1%."
"30 million Americans don't have enough food to eat.

40 million tenants are struggling to pay the rent.

150 million Americans face serious financial problems.

And the Republican Senate continues to do nothing except confirm more right wing judges. That is a national disgrace."
"At a time of massive wealth and income inequality, not only do we need to repeal all of the Trump tax breaks for the top 1% and large corporations, we need to tax the obscene wealth gains billionaires have made during the pandemic and expand Medicare to all."
"The West Coast is on fire, the color of the sky turned red, the air in many parts of the U.S. is dangerous to breathe, there are 5 simultaneous tropical cyclones in the Atlantic, an 800-mile derecho destroyed Iowa towns. And yet they ask: How can we afford the Green New Deal?"

"Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. was right when he said: ‚ÄúWe must recognize that we can‚Äôt solve our problem now until there is a radical redistribution of economic and political power"" in America. Our society cannot sustain itself when so few have so much while so many have so little."
"Make no mistake about it. The Green New Deal is far less expensive than losing our planet to the greed of the fossil fuel industry.

Medicare for All is far less expensive than the status quo that leaves 92 million uninsured or under-insured.

The fight for justice goes on."
"A half million people in Oregon evacuate as wildfires rage. Over 3 million acres in California burned. The western sky is red. An 800-mile derecho destroyed towns in Iowa. The Arctic topped 100 degrees. 

The Green New Deal has been called ""expensive."" 

Compared to what?"
"Today we remember the nearly 3,000 lives lost on 9/11 and the brave people who risked their lives to help that day. Those selfless acts of sacrifice show the very best of us as a nation, and we can honor that sacrifice by working to build a world of security and dignity for all."
"Instead of providing more corporate welfare to billionaires and large corporations, we need to provide more financial relief to the tens of millions of Americans who are hurting like they have never hurt before."
"While Amazon raised prices by up to 1,000% on masks, soap &amp; toilet paper, Jeff Bezos became $88 billion richer and continues to deny workers paid sick leave &amp; hazard pay. That is morally obscene. Billionaires should not be profiteering off a pandemic. #TaxTheRich"
"The 2nd, 3rd &amp; 4th largest wildfires in California's history continue to rage. The sky on the West Coast turned red &amp; orange. Please don't tell me the Green New Deal is radical. What's radical is having a president in office who rejects science and calls climate change a hoax."
"After taking a vacation for over a month, Senate Republicans released a ""skinny relief"" bill that provides $0 for working families, $0 for the uninsured, $0 for food, $0 for rent and $0 for mortgages. But they were able to find $740 billion for the Pentagon in July. Disgraceful."
"How pathetic. While Senate Republicans tell us we can't afford to give $2,000 a month to the working class during the economic crisis, the COVID-19 ""relief"" bill they just released provides $161 million in corporate welfare to the coal industry during a climate emergency."
"This Labor Day, we celebrate workers and the tireless work of the trade union movement for equal rights and economic justice. Together, we will continue the fight to expand workers‚Äô rights and build an economy based on human needs, not greed."

"3.4 million permanent job losses. 

Nearly 30 million Americans are going hungry.

Mitch McConnell and the do-nothing Republican Senate refuse to help the working class. Pathetic."
"Let's be clear. Trump and his crony DeJoy are working overtime to sabotage the Postal Service.

Now is the time for all of us to stand with postal workers fighting to save USPS. Together, we will stop Trump from destroying the Postal Service."
"$3.7 billion in a single day. That's how much 3 members of the Walton family saw their wealth increase. At a time of massive wealth and income inequality, when so many of our people are hurting, that is morally obscene.

It's time to tax billionaires and expand Medicare to all."
"Sanctioning the International Criminal Court shows once again that Trump is on the side of authoritarians around the world. The United States should be working to strengthen international human rights standards, not targeting officials who uphold them."
Trump's disastrous plan to defund Social Security would eliminate retirement and disability benefits by 2023. We're not going to let that happen. We are going to protect and expand Social Security.
"12 million people lost their employer-sponsored health insurance during this pandemic. Meanwhile, health insurers like Anthem, Humana, and UnitedHealth doubled their profits from last year.

Medicare for All means never losing your health insurance if you lose your job. Period."
"Disgusting. Jeff Bezos became the richest man on Earth while spying on, underpaying, and mistreating his workers.

We must build a powerful trade union movement to stand up to the billionaire class and finally say: Enough. You cannot have it all."
"Rent is due tomorrow. My question is this: with 40 million facing the threat of eviction, how in the world does Sen. McConnell think they're going to cobble up enough income to keep a roof over their heads during this crisis?

It is time to cancel rent until this crisis is over."
"When politicians say that climate change is not real, it‚Äôs not just that they‚Äôre lying.

It‚Äôs not just that they‚Äôre rejecting science.

"57 years ago, hundreds of thousands of people came together for the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom. We are still fighting for many of the demands being made then.

Today, we will not only honor the memory of that march, but also carry on the struggle for racial justice."
"Here's the economic reality under Trump:

29 million Americans don't have enough food

30 million unemployed workers lost $600 a week in benefits

40 million face eviction 

All while 467 billionaires made $800 billion in 5 months

Our job: Create an economy that works for all"
"Never forget. While Trump came within 1 vote in the Senate from taking away health insurance from 32 million Americans, his administration had no problem handing out billions in corporate welfare to the pharmaceutical industry ‚Äì the most profitable industry in America."
"The people of Louisiana are now facing 4 emergencies:

‚ö†Ô∏è A massive hurricane

It's time to take on the fossil fuel industry, end environmental racism and provide these communities with all the help they need."
Cancel student debt now. All of it.
"The Green New Deal is not radical, but let me tell you what is:

A president who rejects science and calls climate change a hoax while unprecedented hurricanes batter the Gulf, wildfires rage in the west, an 800-mile derecho destroys towns and the Arctic melts.

That's radical."
"The fact that Jeff Bezos became the world's first $200 billion man at a time of unprecedented human pain and suffering is morally grotesque.

No. Billionaires should not be allowed to make $800 billion during a pandemic.

Our job: Tax the rich and expand Medicare to all."
"Never forget. Over 2 years ago, Trump and the GOP Congress looted the Treasury to give a $1 trillion tax break to the top 1% and large corporations. Now, Trump is working overtime to defund Social Security and the Postal Service. That is the type of looting we have got to end."
"While Trump and the GOP Senate don't believe we can afford to provide the working class another $1,200, they had no problem giving defense contractors $370 billion in corporate welfare to profit from endless war. Yes. That's socialism for the rich, rugged capitalism for the rest."
"Remember the state of the economy before the pandemic:

That's how much the collective net worth of 467 billionaires grew during a pandemic that has cost 30 million jobs and 176,000 lives.

It's time to tax billionaires and guarantee health care to all."
"The Social Security Administration confirmed what we already knew. Trump's disastrous plan to defund Social Security would eliminate retirement and disability benefits by 2023. That may make sense to the billionaires at Trump's country club, but it makes zero sense to me."
"The Postmaster General needs to resign or be removed from office now. We need a Postmaster General who will work overtime to ensure the prompt delivery of mail‚Äînot a top Trump campaign contributor who is undermining the Postal Service and slowing down the mail.

"Warren Buffett was right. There is class warfare in America and his side is winning. While 40 million Americans face eviction, 10 billionaires increased their wealth by $368 billion since March. We need to tax the rich and create an economy that works for all of us, not the 1%."
"With so many unprecedented crises facing our nation, we must never lose sight of the most existential planetary threat: climate change.

If we don't get our act together soon, extreme weather disturbances will continue to get more severe. We need a Green New Deal."
"Today, the House acted decisively to reverse Trump's efforts to undermine the Postal Service and sabotage the election.

Now, it is time for the do-nothing Republican Senate to end its vacation and act to save the Post Office and protect working families."
It's absolutely unacceptable that Postmaster General DeJoy (a top campaign contributor to Trump) has refused to restore the mail sorting machines he removed in states like Wisconsin and Michigan. This is a clear attempt to slow down the mail and suppress the vote. DeJoy must go.
"Listen to the American people. They are hurting. They cannot pay their rent or put food on the table. 
 
President Trump and Senator McConnell: Enough. No more golfing. No more vacations. Pass the relief our people need NOW."
"The American people are fighting to defend USPS and our democracy from Trump and his crony Postmaster General DeJoy. 

DeJoy must answer for his disturbing financial conflicts of interest and attempt to sabotage USPS. And we must pass legislation to fully fund and protect USPS."

"We cannot allow Trump to put the fossil fuel industry's short-term profits ahead of the climate and rights of indigenous peoples.

We must stand with the Gwich'in Nation, stop this drilling in the Arctic, and aggressively transition away from fossil fuels."
"This is what a rigged economy looks like. While 5.4 million Americans recently lost their health insurance, the top 12 billionaires in our country are now worth over $1 trillion. That is morally obscene. We need to tax the rich and expand Medicare to all."
"43 million Americans face the threat of eviction.

It's time to cancel rent and mortgage payments until this crisis is over."
"We will not let Trump destroy the Post Office to sabotage this election. This is a democracy, not a dictatorship."
Grocery store workers put their lives on the line every day to keep us fed during this pandemic. They are heroes. They deserve more than empty gestures from the corporations exploiting them‚Äîthey deserve hazard pay and the protective gear they need.
"During the worst economic crisis since the 1930s, Mitch McConnell and Senate Republicans think they can take a long vacation while millions of Americans face hunger and eviction. That is morally obscene. It's time for the do-nothing Republican Senate to finally do its damn job."

"Sitting at his luxury golf club, Trump issued executive orders that:

"Maybe, just maybe, Betsy DeVos and Donald Trump should listen to teachers and public health experts instead of threatening to cut funding for public schools."
"The $600 a week in additional unemployment insurance has helped American workers afford their medicine, put food on the table, and keep roofs over their heads.

Why the hell did Republicans just strip this lifeline away from 30 million workers trying to survive this pandemic?"

We cannot allow Orwellian facial recognition technology to continue to violate the privacy and civil liberties of the American people."
"3 in 4 Americans‚Äîincluding 58% of Republicans‚Äîsupport requiring mask wearing.

We have got to make high-quality masks free for everyone in this country.

30 million without an unemployment lifeline.
5 million newly uninsured.
14 million children going hungry.
 
But Trump is too busy playing golf and boasting about the stock market. Obscene."
"Trump's recent tweet that we delay our election ""is fascistic and itself grounds for immediate impeachment."" That's not Bernie Sanders talking. That's Steven Calabresi, co-founder of the rightwing Federalist Society.

Trump is a threat to democracy. Together we will defeat him."
"President Obama is absolutely right. It is an outrage that modern-day poll taxes, gerrymandering, I.D. requirements, and other forms of voter suppression still exist today. If expanding the Voting Rights Act requires us to eliminate the filibuster, then that is what we must do."
"No, Mr. President. We are not going to postpone the presidential election. Read the Constitution (for once). On Nov. 3, the American people will decide upon your disastrous administration and reject your authoritarianism, lies and racism. You will lose. Bye, bye."

What I am asking for is straightforward: Masks for All.
What does the $600 a week in additional unemployment insurance mean for you and your family?
"Our public health experts are telling us universal mask wearing can bring this pandemic under control within weeks.

This is not political or partisan issue. We must provide all of our people with high-quality, reusable masks‚Äîfree of charge‚Äîand save lives."
"Last week's $740 billion military spending bill wasn't enough. Senate Republicans want $29 billion more for the Pentagon as they try to slash weekly unemployment benefits from $600 to $200 for 30 million Americans who lost their jobs.
 
""Pathetic"" is too mild of a word for this."
"We are the only major country where coronavirus infections and deaths are skyrocketing. That is beyond disgraceful.

As we commemorate the 30th anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act today, we must fight to ensure that every person with a disability has the right to live in their community and has the support they need to thrive."
"4 million coronavirus cases. Over 140,000 deaths.

As other countries‚Äô infections decline, America's are surging.

Trump's incompetence is literally killing Americans."
"We are in the worst economic condition since the Great Depression. People are worried about getting evicted from their homes. People can't go to the doctor because they lost their jobs and no longer have any health insurance.

Now is the time for Congress to act boldly."
"The $740 billion military budget is not enough for Senate Republicans. Now they want to give the Pentagon an additional $21 billion. 

Instead of making the CEOs of defense contractors richer, we should provide every working class American $2,000 a month until this crisis ends."
"We have a president who really does not believe in democracy.

What Trump is saying is: I don't care what mayors say, I don't care what governors say, I am the president, I will send federal agents to Portland or any place in this country.

That is what a police state is about."
"Today, almost half the Senate Democratic Caucus‚Äî23 members‚Äîvoted to cut Pentagon spending by 10% and invest in human needs. This is far and away the most significant step in recent years to address our bloated $740 billion military budget and changing our national priorities."
"Today the Senate will be voting on my amendment that says clearly: Cut the Pentagon budget by 10%. Invest in jobs, education, housing and healthcare here at home. #PeopleOverPentagon"
"A 10% cut to the Pentagon could provide high-quality childcare to every family in America, regardless of income.

It's time to put #PeopleOverPentagon. I will be on the Senate floor today at 11:20 AM to fight for our amendment to defund the Pentagon and invest in our people."
"Why do we spend more on the military than the next 11 nations combined? Why do millions live in poverty in the richest country in the world?

It's time to change our national priorities. @SenSchumer and I are fighting to cut Pentagon spending by 10% and invest it in human needs."
"Trump's proposed payroll tax cut would do nothing for the 30 million who lost jobs during the pandemic while taking money away from Social Security.

Instead, we must extend unemployment benefits, provide $2,000 a month to every working-class American, and expand Medicare to all."
"Eisenhower once said: ‚ÄúEvery gun that is made, every warship launched, every rocket fired signifies, in the final sense, a theft from those who hunger and are not fed, those who are cold and are not clothed.‚Äù

It's time to cut the Pentagon budget by 10% and invest in human needs."
"We don't need more nuclear weapons. We don't need more fighter jets.

We do need decent housing and health care for our people."
John Lewis inspired millions to fight for justice. His courage helped transform this country. He won‚Äôt ever be forgotten by those who believe America can change when the people stand together and demand it. Our thoughts are with his loved ones.
Unmarked federal agents in combat gear are pulling protesters off the street and jailing them without charge. That is what a police state is all about. Now is the time to defend our Constitution. Now is the time to come together and defeat Trump's authoritarian policies.
"Widespread mask wearing could save tens of thousands of lives and $1 trillion in economic activity.

@ASlavitt and I believe our government must lead the effort to produce and distribute high-quality masks for every American at no cost: Masks for All."
"As coronavirus ravages our communities and millions go jobless, Senate Republicans want to spend $740 billion on bombs and missiles.

Dr. King warned that a society with these priorities is approaching spiritual death. It's time to cut the Pentagon budget."
"Tens of millions of Americans will soon lose their $600-a-week unemployment benefits. The result: More desperation, hunger and evictions. 

Congress must act. At this unprecedented moment in American history, we cannot turn our backs on the working families of this country."
"I stand with 100 grassroots organizations demanding that the U.S. end its suspension of @USAID aid to Yemen. During this horrific humanitarian crisis, we should end our military support to Saudi Arabia instead.

Yemen needs food, medicine, and health care‚Äînot bombs and blockades."
"Trump's incompetence has been deadly. Six months after the first U.S. coronavirus case was reported, health workers are still reusing masks, gowns and gloves in the wealthiest country on Earth.

Congress must act NOW to produce the protective gear we need."
"Instead of spending more on Trump's Space Force and a ""super-duper missile"" program designed to kill as many people as possible, let's invest more in health care, education, and housing for our people here at home. 

It's time to cut the Pentagon."
"What we are witnessing is the absolute absurdity of our profit-driven, employer-based, private health care system.

Health care can no longer be an employee benefit‚Äîwe must make it a human right, through Medicare for All."
"More than 30% of American families could not pay their July rent and 28 million people could become homeless if we don't act.

What are the Republicans' priorities during this economic crisis? Passing a $135 billion tax break for their millionaire donors."
"The pandemic has been an economic nightmare for the working class. Millions have lost their jobs and their health care‚Äînow they may lose their homes. Not acceptable. We need government of the people, by the people, for the people. Congress must act boldly."
"In the midst of a pandemic, an economic meltdown, systemic racism and climate change, Republicans and Democrats want to pass a record-breaking $740 billion military budget.

My amendment cuts military spending by 10% and uses the savings to help the poor."
Let me thank @SenSchumer for his support for my amendment to cut the bloated $740 billion Pentagon budget by 10% and invest $74 billion in communities that have been ravaged by extreme poverty and mass incarceration. This amendment will begin to change our national priorities.
"Remdesivir costs less than $10 to manufacture. @GileadSciences is charging $3,100 for it.
 
Taxpayers spent $70 million to develop this drug. Coronavirus has killed 130,000 Americans. It's time to take control of this patent and provide remdesivir to all who need it."
"The richest 1% owe 70% of all unpaid taxes. With the money from these tax cheats, we could do all this:

üë©üèΩ‚ÄçüéìTuition-free college
üë©‚Äçüë¶‚Äçüë¶End child hunger
üö∞Clean water for all
üè°Build 500,000 affordable homes
üò∑Masks and PPE for all
üì¨Fully fund the Post Office"
"No national testing program. No adequate production of protective gear. No commitment to a free vaccine.
 
As almost every major country sees the spread of coronavirus decline, America's infections are spiking.
 
Trump's incompetence is killing people."
"You don't need a Ph.D in economics to know this, but it can't hurt: We need direct, monthly cash payments for everybody in America until this crisis is over."
Evictions must be banned for the entirety of this crisis. This is a matter of racial and economic justice that Congress cannot ignore.
"The cruelty of this White House knows no bounds. Foreign students are being threatened with a choice: risk your life going to class in-person or get deported.

We must stand up to Trump's bigotry. We must keep all our students safe."
"If Target just did it, you can be damn sure @Walmart, owned by the wealthiest family in America, can raise its starting wage to $15 an hour."
"American taxpayers are already funding the development of a coronavirus vaccine. When it is ready, we must put it in the public domain and ensure that it's available to all.

No more privatizing, monopolizing and profiteering by Big Pharma."
"The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and millions of others who fought against the Dakota Access Pipeline showed us the power of standing together against injustice.

We can create a future where a clean environment and indigenous rights matter more than Big Oil‚Äôs profits."
"The Trump administration is focused on making it harder for homeless trans people to get safe shelter during this pandemic. That is outrageous.

As a society, we can‚Äîand we must‚Äîend homelessness and housing discrimination against trans people."
"This is a major victory for the millions-strong climate justice movement, which fought for years to stop this pipeline.

Together, we will secure clean air and good jobs building a renewable-energy economy that protects the only planet we have."
"As a pandemic rages, public health departments across America are being starved and are on the verge of collapse.

Meanwhile, billionaires have seen their wealth grow by $565 billion.

That is what oligarchy looks like."
"The minimum wage is worth less than it was 50 years ago.

If wages had gone up with productivity, today it would be three times higher.

Corporate America has been waging a war on workers for decades. It's about time working people stand up and fight back."
"Throughout our history, demagogues have always tried to demonize different people to divide us up.

We will not let Trump succeed. We will break down the irrational hatred he is fomenting. We are going to build a politics of love, compassion, and unity."
"This holiday weekend, let us reflect on the disturbing reality behind every plate of food‚Äîworkers are being exploited and put at risk every day.

They don‚Äôt need more lip service, they need justice: Hazard pay, sick leave, $15 an hour and a safe workplace."
"Jane and I wish you and your loved ones a very happy Independence Day.

Together, we can and will create the kind of nation based on love and justice that we know we can become."
"I believe that right now, the American people want real transformation.

They want us to invest in health care, jobs and education for all, so that they can live their lives with dignity and security.

They want a government which represents all of us, not the 1%."
"No, Mr. Trump, coronavirus will not just ‚Äúdisappear.‚Äù We need to pass legislation to fight this pandemic and protect the American people. That means:

üò∑ Masks for all
üß™ Free testing for all
üíä Health care for all
üë®‚Äçüë©‚Äçüëß Economic security for all"
"I am proud to join @SenatorDurbin on this legislation to have the IMF provide financial support to the developing world, at no cost to U.S. taxpayers.

It is the very least we can do to prevent unimaginable increases in poverty, hunger, and disease that threaten the world's poor."
"How on earth can airlines‚Äîin the middle of pandemic‚Äîfly their planes at full capacity?

I am demanding federal action to require social distancing, mask-wearing, and disinfection in planes and airports.

We must put the safety of passengers and workers ahead of corporate profits."
"No one is above the law. @SenMarkey, @SenWarren, and I introduced a bill to abolish ‚Äúqualified immunity"" so police officers can be held fully accountable for abuses they commit, just like everybody else."
"üö® 14.7 million Americans are still out of work. Coronavirus infections are rising at an unprecedented rate. üö®

Until this crisis is over, we must:

üíµProvide $2,000 a month per person
üè•Ensure medical care without cost
üë∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èGuarantee workers' wages
üí≥Extend unemployment benefits"
"Instead of addressing the surge in hunger due to this economic meltdown, the Senate is rushing to pass a $740 billion military budget.

We need to fundamentally alter our national priorities. It's time to eradicate hunger in America. It's time to increase nutrition support."
"Today, workers in Washington, DC will get paid at least $15 an hour. This is what happens when workers raise their voices, organize and demand to be heard. It‚Äôs time for Congress to raise the minimum wage to a living wage of $15 an hour for all workers."
"One theory is that by spending $740,000,000,000 on the most sophisticated weapons of mass destruction in world history, we'll be safer.

I'm not so sure.

Maybe what makes us safer is breaking down fear and hatred around the world, so that we can recognize our common humanity."
"Rent is due. But over 40 million Americans lost their jobs because of this horrific pandemic. How are they expected to put together the income to make rent?

It is time to cancel rent and mortgage payments until this crisis is over."
"Alec Smith died at 26 because he was rationing insulin that was too expensive. 

Now Big Pharma is suing to block a law passed in his honor to make insulin more affordable.

Let‚Äôs be clear about this: Big Pharma‚Äôs greed is literally killing people in this country."
"I am LIVE in the Senate to oppose a $740 billion military budget without being able to vote on amendments.

The American people deserve a real debate before we build more bombs instead ofschools."
"How can it be that the United States‚Äîwith just 4% of the world‚Äôs population‚Äîaccounts for 25% of the world‚Äôs coronavirus deaths?

Our people are dying every day because of Trump‚Äôs lies and incompetence."
"Unbelievable. Facial recognition technology identifies the wrong person 96% of the time according to Detroit's police chief.

We must ban facial recognition technology for policing."
"Israel's annexation of occupied territory would be a disaster for international law, self-determination, freedom and equality.

I stand with @AOC and House progressives. We cannot allow U.S. tax dollars to be used to violate Palestinians' human rights."
"Join me NOW: I urge my colleagues to stop pouring billions of dollars into wars and weapons.

President Eisenhower and Dr. King were right. We need the guts to say NO to the military industrial complex and start focusing on real humanneeds."
"Health care workers who risk their lives every day fighting this pandemic are being denied the personal protective equipment they need. 

The Trump administration's response: Ignoring thousands of workers' safety complaints. Beyond outrageous."
"In the midst of a pandemic, the Senate is voting on a $740 billion Pentagon budget.

I will be presenting an alternative: Cut the military by 10% to invest in health care, jobs, housing, and the environment.

It's time to transform our national priorities."
"The $600 in additional weekly unemployment income passed by Congress saved millions from financial ruin.

Ending it could cost 5 million jobs and hurt countless struggling families. As coronavirus cases rise, we must extend this critical lifeline."
"How the hell can two people be charged $200 or $6,400 for the same test?

No rational person can accept our dysfunctional, profit-driven health care system.

No more greed. It's time to make health care a human right. It's time to pass Medicare for All."
"Trump's lies and incompetence have cost us lives.

America's coronavirus cases are skyrocketing even as other major countries have controlled its spread.

Congress must step up. We need to act urgently to guarantee robust testing, tracing, masks, and medical treatment for all."
"Taxpayers provided funding for the development of this drug. Now Gilead is price-gouging off it during a pandemic. Beyond disgusting. 

Coronavirus treatment must be free to all."
Extremist Republican legislators lost again today. Abortion is a constitutional right and we will make damn sure it stays that way.
Billionaires are waging class war against the working people of this country in the middle of a pandemic. That is obscene. It‚Äôs time to stand up and fight back.
"Whether it is:

üåé Transforming our energy system away from fossil fuel
‚úä Fighting systemic racism
üè• Ending a cruel and dysfunctional healthcare system
üìà Addressing the grotesque level of wealth inequality in our country

Now is the time for change‚Äîreal change."
"It is unbelievable that this has to be said, but no: reducing testing will not make this pandemic go away.

Trump's decision to pull federal support for testing is threatening the health of millions of people."
"Unemployment rate:
üá∫üá∏ 13%
üá¨üáß 4%

Why? The United Kingdom provided paychecks to its workers and kept them employed. It's about time we do the same."
"Today, the House rightly recognized that D.C.'s 700,000 residents deserve full citizenship as Americans.

If Senate Republicans are sincere in their belief that there can be no taxation without representation, they must immediately schedule a vote to grant statehood to D.C."
"As coronavirus cases rise, nurses are demanding that this for-profit, corporate hospital chain provide them with the protective gear and staffing support they need to care for their patients.

I stand with the nurses striking across this country today."
"Cut the Pentagon. Feed, shelter, educate, and employ all our people."
Do not tell me that a Green New Deal is ‚Äúradical.‚Äù What‚Äôs radical is doing nothing to stop climate change while the Arctic is on fire.
I said it in 1993 and I'll say it again today: D.C. statehood now!
"Why do we spend more on the military than the next 11 nations combined? I have a better idea: Cut Pentagon spending by 10% and invest it in the fight to end homelessness, hunger and poverty in the richest country onEarth."
"Join me in a half hour, when I will speak on the Senate floor about my effort with @repmarkpocan, @RepBarbaraLee and @SenMarkey to reduce military spending by 10% and invest that money in communities ravaged by poverty, mass incarceration, deindustrialization and systemic racism."
"Over fifty years ago, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. warned us that ‚Äúa nation that continues year after year to spend more money on military defense than on programs of social uplift is approaching spiritual death.‚Äù

That is what our amendment is all about."
"President Trump and Senate Republicans would rather deny science than provide the American people with the economic relief and leadership they need, threatening the lives of hundreds of thousands of Americans.

Absolutely shameful."
"Today, Republicans pushed empty gestures on police reform. No. Enough lip service.

Any serious effort must ban chokeholds, abolish legal immunity, create unarmed civilian first responders, and strip federal funds for police that violate civil rights."
"How the hell can corporations going bankrupt and laying off workers still hand out million-dollar bonuses to their CEOs?

CEOs love this game: Heads, I win. Tails, you lose.

This is why workers must get a say in their companies and seats on their boards."
"Robert Julian-Borchak Williams was wrongfully arrested because racist facial recognition technology misidentified him for a crime he did not commit.

We can't allow this to happen again. It's time to ban facial recognition technology for policing."
"The pandemic surges, people die, and Trump continues to ignore reality. Let us save lives by using the Defense Production Act to produce high quality masks for everyone, and distribute them free to every household. That's the legislation I am introducing."
"Responding to the pandemic with a fierce sense of urgency means providing every working-class person in America with an emergency $2,000 payment each month until this crisis is over so that they can pay the rent, feed their families and make ends meet."
"Vulnerable nursing home residents are being kicked out on the street to fend for themselves, in a pandemic, because they're considered ""less-profitable."" How disgusting!

We cannot tolerate a health care system driven by such staggering greed and cruelty."
"We must make it easier to vote‚Äînot harder. No one should be forced to wait in line for hours to participate in our elections. 

Our job is to fight racist voter suppression everywhere, restore the Voting Rights Act, and create a vibrant democracy."
"America can give tax breaks to billionaires, no problem. But somehow when it comes to workers' rights, we are the worst among major countries.

Here's a radical idea: Maybe working people in the wealthiest country on Earth should get to live with dignity."
"If the U.S. does not end its involvement in the Saudi-led war, millions of Yemenis may die of famine. It makes me very proud to see our young people organizing together to bring this horrific conflict to an end."
"We have three major issues going on in this country: an economic meltdown, a horrific pandemic, and people out in the streets demanding racial justice in America.
 
Senate Leader Mitch McConnell, what is your leadership doing to address these issues? Nothing. Do your job."
"Target just raised the minimum wage for its 275,000 workers to $15 an hour. 

Now is the time for Walmart to also raise their minimum wage to at least $15 an hour.

I suspect the world's richest family, the Walton family, can afford it."
"To stop the spread of the coronavirus, and to reduce the obscene racial disparities in our criminal justice system, we must take urgent federal action to dramatically reduce the prison population."
"It is time that we, as a nation, come to terms with slavery's horrors and how they affect every aspect of our lives today. I am proud to celebrate #Juneteenth with Mr. Danny Glover."
"As the son of an immigrant, I congratulate the countless activists who made today‚Äôs Supreme Court decision possible. 

Together, we will reverse all the cruel things Trump has done to harm immigrants and ensure a pathway to citizenship for all undocumented people in America."
"The real unemployment rate is over 20%‚Äîthe highest since the Great Depression. No, Mr. Trump, this is not the time to take a victory lap. 

The government must guarantee 100% of the paychecks and benefits of American workers up to $90,000/year. Pass the Paycheck Security Act now."
This is a major victory for grassroots activists and a blow to Trump‚Äôs hideous effort to end legal protections for our undocumented youth. Now we must quickly pass legislation to provide a path to citizenship for Dreamers and the 11 million undocumented in this country.
"I'm LIVE now, speaking on the floor of the U.S. Senate.

In every state in America, people are hurting and calling out for help. Let us hear their cries.

Let us act now to end police brutality, halt a deadly pandemic, and provide economic relief toall."
"Target‚Äôs announcement today shows us that a $15 minimum wage is an idea whose time has come. Years of grassroots organizing has created an unstoppable movement. Now the Senate must pass our Raise the Wage Act and guarantee a dignified, living wage for every worker in America."
"It‚Äôs time to abolish ‚Äúqualified immunity"" so police officers can be held fully accountable for abuses they commit. No one is above the law."
"President Trump forced hazardous meat plants to reopen to protect the profits of large corporations over the lives of meatpacking workers who got sick and died from coronavirus.

Beyond disgusting. It's time to put people before profits."
President Trump‚Äôs effort to dismantle the Postal Service would be a disaster for our seniors. We can't let Trump and his cronies have their way. Congress must act to save the Postal Service so seniors can access life-saving medication and mail-in ballots.
"This pandemic is not going away any time soon. Our people are struggling. A one-time $1,200 check sure as hell ain‚Äôt cutting it. 

Congress has got to get its act together and provide monthly $2,000 payments to all‚Äîand make it cover the past three months."
"I‚Äôll be damned if when a COVID-19 vaccine is developed, more people die because they can‚Äôt afford to purchase it. Any life-saving vaccine must be free."
Ban them.
"This is what oligarchy looks like. During the pandemic, 630 billionaires have seen their wealth go up by $565 billion while almost everyone else has seen their wealth go down by $6.5 trillion. We cannot push this grotesque inequality under the rug."
"The Supreme Court shamefully chose to protect the profits of the fossil fuel industry today over the future of our planet.
 
Our job: Rapidly transition away from fossil fuels like fracked natural gas and create millions of jobs in sustainable energy."
"Fantastic news. No one in America should face discrimination for being who they are or for who they love.

Together, we are going to defeat the hate and bigotry of this administration and stand with our LGBTQ+ family. Congratulations to everyone who fought to make this happen."
"New Zealand, a small country of 5 million, did something interesting: They listened to scientists. They virtually eliminated COVID-19. Bold and intelligent action saved lives. In our country, tragically, incompetent leadership continues to cost us lives."
"Instead of spending more money on weapons of mass destruction designed to kill as many people as possible, maybe‚Äîjust maybe‚Äîwe should invest in improving lives right here in the United States of America. That's what my amendment is all about."
"George Floyd's murder is the only latest in an endless series of police killings. 

Eric Garner, Sandra Bland, Laquan McDonald, Tamir Rice, Alton Sterling, Breonna Taylor, Freddie Gray, Rekia Boyd, Walter Scott‚Äîand so many, many others.

The U.S. Senate has got to act now."
"Why, in the richest country in the history of the world, aren't we treating ending hunger in America like a top priority?

We must substantially expand the Meals on Wheels program, school meals programs, and SNAP benefits."
"CBP and ICE are out of control. It‚Äôs time to hold these officials accountable for abuses, dismantle our cruel immigration system, and build a new one that is accountable, humane, and just."
"Congratulations‚Äînow that @Instacart is worth $14 billion, maybe it can afford hazard pay and paid sick leave for all its workers."
"This is yet another move by Trump that will be welcomed by authoritarians around the world. The United States should be leading the way in upholding international human rights standards, not targeting ICC personnel and their families with sanctions."
"How the hell is it possible that 35 million people still have not gotten the one-time $1,200 they are owed? A check that was never going to be enough in the first place?

Congress must provide $2,000 a month to all‚Äîand make it cover the past three months."
"Facial recognition technology violates the privacy and civil liberties of Americans, and deepens racial bias in policing.

Congress must ban facial recognition technology for all policing."
"Another 1.5 million Americans filed for unemployment last week while President Trump takes an absurd victory lap. How pathetic is that?

The Senate should be acting with a fierce sense of urgency to provide everyone with income, paychecks, and health care during this emergency."
"I get a little tired of seeing these TV ads from big corporations thanking heroes on the frontlines of the pandemic. Well that's great, thank them‚Äîbut PAY them more than starvation wages for their extremely hazardous work."
"When Emperor Nero played his fiddle as Rome burned, at least he provided some entertainment to his court.

Senator McConnell is doing nothing.

This is the worst do-nothing Senate in modern American history. Every member of this body should be ashamed."
"What have we come to as a country when undocumented people are locked up and forced to be exposed to coronavirus with zero regard for their safety?

We must dismantle our country's violent detention and deportation machine."
"Medical workers trying to save lives have gone months without adequate masks, gloves, and gowns.

Police officers cracking down on protest are fully equipped with rubber bullets, pepper spray, and tasers.

Maybe it is time that we fundamentally rethink our national priorities."
"For over 100 days since this pandemic began, frontline workers have been making unbelievable sacrifices every single day. From the bottom of our hearts, my staff and I say to all essential workers: Thank you."
"I stand with these workers. When Martin Luther King was killed in 1968, he was supporting a strike by under-paid, mostly Black sanitation workers in Memphis, Tennessee.

Now more than ever, 50 years later, we must defeat the evils of racism and poverty."
"Why is it, that in the wealthiest country in modern history, high school students who live four miles apart have radically different access to education?

This pandemic has laid bare the deep injustices that existed long before the crisis."
"Let me be clear: postal workers are heroes. Letter carriers like James Daniels risk their lives every day to ensure all Americans can get the necessities they need during this crisis. 

Congress must act to save the Postal Service and these essential jobs."
"How the hell can debt-collecting vultures still be allowed to garnish people‚Äôs wages at a time like this?

I have a radical idea: maybe Congress should stand up for ordinary people in the middle of a pandemic and stop all debt collection right now."
"Bills are piling up, rent is due, millions are jobless. A one-time $1,200 check won‚Äôt cut it.

We need to provide $2,000 a month to every man, woman and child‚Äîand make it retroactive to cover the past three months.

If we can bail out corporations, we can ensure everyone‚Äôs needs."
Two protests. Two radically different responses from the President and police. See if you can spot the difference.
"40% of households making $40,000 or less have lost their jobs.
 
13% of those making $100,000 or more did.
 
If those numbers were flipped, you can be damn sure Republicans would move mountains to pass emergency relief.

Enough! It‚Äôs time to put working families first‚Äînot last."
"What does a rigged, corrupt economy look like?

Over the past 11 weeks, as 42 million workers lost jobs and nearly half of our people lost income, 630 U.S. billionaires increased their wealth by $565,000,000,000.

Unfettered capitalism is not sustainable."
"Today we remember the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre, when China‚Äôs government ordered the military to crush pro-democracy protesters. We must stand with those working for democracy and dignity around the world, and practice and protect those values here at home."
"Millions of Americans are going without work, food and health care.

Trump's response: Eviscerate the Endangered Species Act so that fossil fuel CEOs can more easily pollute our air and water.

How absurd is that?"
How pathetic. Endless wars all across the planet aren't enough for the neocons. Now they want to deploy U.S. soldiers against Americans exercising their First Amendment right at home. No. We cannot let them trample over the Constitution or harm our fellow Americans.
Every police department violating people's civil rights must be stripped of federal funding.
"I simply cannot believe‚Äîafter 100,000 Americans have lost their lives‚Äîthat this Trump official refuses to commit to making any effective COVID-19 vaccine free for all. That is obscene."
"Across America, our schools are facing a financial meltdown and millions of kids struggle with hunger.

Meanwhile, billionaire Betsy DeVos is making $56-100 million a year.

She will go down in history as the worst, most out-of-touch Education Secretary to ever hold that office."
We have got to act boldly to eradicate systemic racism and police violence. I am calling for sweeping policy reforms to protect people‚Äîparticularly communities of color‚Äîwho have suffered violence for far too long.
"Treasury official Justin Muzinich is managing Trump's bailout program.

A top beneficiary? Muzinich &amp; Co. investment firm, where Muzinich owns a $60 million stake.

This is what ""drain the swamp"" is all about. Using the government to enrich Trump's Wall Street friends."
"The American people are sick and tired of police abuse without consequences. Congress must end ""qualified immunity"" now so that police can be held accountable for wrongdoing, just like everybody else."
"Pope Francis is absolutely right. During the worst public-health crisis in 100 years, we must cut funding for making weapons to kill each other and invest those resources in real human needs, like a coronavirus vaccine available to all."
"$16,000,000,000,000. Sixteen trillion, with a ""t.""

That's the estimated long-term economic harm caused by this pandemic.

@SenSchumer and I have a simple question: Why the hell won't Senator McConnell act like this is a crisis and pass emergency relief NOW?"
"More than 17 misconduct complaints were filed against Officer Chauvin, but he stayed on the force for years.

That is outrageous. George Floyd would still be alive if we had real police accountability.

We need a massive overhaul of policing in America."
No parent should have to send their sick child to school because she or he can't take a day from work. We need paid family leave in this country‚Äîduring this pandemic and after it ends.
"40 million have lost their jobs. 100,000 are dead from coronavirus. Millions go hungry.

I cannot comprehend how Senator McConnell can say he hasn't ""felt the urgency of acting immediately"" to pass legislation to protect Americans' health and wellbeing."
"The richest 400 Americans sit on $3 trillion‚Äîthe size of the entire UK economy.
 
The billionaire class now pays a lower tax rate than people living paycheck to paycheck.
 
The looting of America has been going on for over 40 years‚Äîand the culprits are the ultra-rich."
Our job is to demilitarize police departments so they do not look like and act like oppressing armies.
"Our most vulnerable communities are hungry, desperate and under enormous emotional stress. It is incomprehensible for Senator Mitch McConnell to tell us that he sees no urgency in passing another emergency relief bill and that he wants to wait another month before taking action."
What gives me hope right now are the new generations of young people who dream big and do not want to settle for the status quo.
A great nation is not judged by its number of billionaires or corporate tax breaks. It's judged by how we treat our most vulnerable people.
"No matter how badly Trump wants to use the coronavirus pandemic to give handouts to the coal, oil and gas industries, they simply can't compete with renewables. We should be bailing out the working families of this country, not the wealthy oil and coal companies."
"Internet access is a necessity, not a luxury. This crisis has made that clearer than ever before. 

How are kids supposed to learn from home without internet? How can small businesses run if they can't get online?

We need high-speed internet for all."
"Food insecurity in households with children has increased by 130%. How, in the wealthiest country in the world, can we allow our children to go hungry?

We have got to make emergency nutrition support available to all families in need."
"1.4 million people who work in the health industry have no health insurance at all. Americans are working in hospitals amid a deadly pandemic without any health coverage.

How insane is that?

We need Medicare for All."
"Since Day One of this crisis, Trump downplayed the danger, disregarded science, refused to make protective gear we need.

Now he says, ‚ÄúHey, I'm tough! Ignore those Democrats. Let's get back to work.‚Äù

100,000 are dead. We still have no national testing strategy. What a disgrace."
"We must cancel rent and mortgage payments until this crisis is over.

We must halt evictions and foreclosures until this crisis is over."
"Join us live as we discuss the critical issues impacting the Hispanic community during this pandemic with @LULAC:

Participen en nuestro di√°logo sobre los asuntos cr√≠ticos que afectan la comunidad latina durante esta pandemia:"
"This is what corporate welfare is all about: The taxpayers fund the research, Gilead will make huge profits, and consumers will pay outrageous prices.

Drug companies cannot charge any price they want. These prices must be negotiated with the government."
"11,000 coronavirus cases are tied to Tyson Foods, Smithfield Foods and JBS. It is our meat processing workers and other so-called ""low-level"" employees who now face the greatest risk of illness and death.

I don't care where you work. Our job is to keep all people alive."
"Vermont's enormous lines for food assistance today show just how dire this crisis is, all across America.

No one should be going hungry right now in the richest country on Earth. The federal government has got to provide all the resources we need to protect these families."
"Maybe Jeff Bezos, the richest man on earth, should focus on providing all his workers with paid sick leave instead of pushing out propaganda to local news stations."
"No family should have to fight their insurance company over a $2,000 bill for coronavirus treatment.

Our legislation says: We will lift this burden off your shoulders. Medicare will cover all out-of-pocket medical costs for the duration of this crisis."
"We cannot have 50 states going at it alone. What we need is testing going on all over this country so when we reopen the economy, workers understand they are working in a safe environment."
"This Memorial Day, we say to veterans who came home from war that we honor your service, and we will make sure every man and woman who has served our country gets the best health care they can through a strong Veterans Administration."

"During the first two+ months of the pandemic:

Some Americans who lost poverty-wage jobs are receiving $600 a week in extra unemployment benefits. Republican response: How outrageous!

630 billionaires made $434 billion in profits. Republican response: Crickets.

Tax the rich."
"Jet flyovers and corporate TV ads ain't gonna cut it. If we truly want to honor our frontline workers, we must guarantee to them:

üí™$15 minimum wage
‚úäüèæRight to a union

"This economic crisis is unprecedented. The solution is straightforward: Keep everyone on their employers' payrolls, getting their regular paychecks and benefits.

Congress must pass our Paycheck Security Act and put an end to mass unemployment."
"This is what our government is paying to develop a COVID19 vaccine:

- $1.2 billion to AstraZeneca
- $483 million to Moderna
- $500 million to Johnson &amp; Johnson
- $30 million to Sanofi

Once a vaccine is approved by the FDA, it must be available to all for free. No profiteering."
"How great is an American economy in which people suddenly go into desperation if they don't receive a check for a week or two?

We need to take a deep breath and say: All people deserve economic security. You've got a job, then you must earn a living wage, not a starvation wage."
"During this pandemic, nearly 40 million have lost their jobs.

How are billionaires doing? They got $434 billion richer.

The ultra-rich have been waging a war on the working class of this country. It‚Äôs time working people stand up, fight back, and win."
"In Denmark, McDonald's workers get $22 an hour, 6 weeks of paid vacation, 1 year of paid family leave, and pensions.

In America, McDonald's workers make $9 an hour, get no benefits, and have to go on strike to get hand sanitizer during a pandemic. Enough."
"It is truly outrageous that Senate Republicans refuse to act as tens of millions lose their jobs, income and health care.

It‚Äôs time to join the rest of the world. Congress must make sure that every worker keeps their paycheck and health insurance until this crisis is over."
"We need a national policy, based upon science, which helps states and communities go forward‚Äîbring workers back, bring kids back to school, if necessary‚Äîbut do so in a safe way that does not needlessly sacrifice thousands of lives."
"Michigan families face a new threat: flooding made worse by climate change and a failure to invest in infrastructure.

This disaster reminds us we are all Americans. When any community is in trouble, all of our resources must be mobilized. Our thoughts are with everyone impacted."
"In this difficult moment, do not allow Trump and his friends to divide us up.

Let us stand with Asian Americans who are fighting racism and xenophobia‚Äîeven as they care for the sick.

Now is the time to act with unprecedented compassion and solidarity."
"If we can bail out large corporations, we can ensure everyone in this country has the income to support themselves and afford basic necessities during this crisis. One $1,200 check ain't enough."
"The CEO of @kroger got paid $21.1 million a year as its workers struggle to get by on $26,000.

Kroger got a 30% boost in sales in March, but is ending $2-an-hour hazard pay.

Disgusting. It can damn well afford to pay grocery workers a dignified wage as they risk their lives."
"Pompeo told Congress the Saudis were ""protecting"" civilians as they bombed Yemen.

Trump issued a fake ""emergency"" to keep selling bombs.

A Raytheon lobbyist became Secretary of Defense.

Thousands of Yemenis died, Raytheon profits went up.

Trump is now covering up this crime."
"It is a scandal that we have a president of the United States who does not understand the function of government.
 
We should have national policies to deal with this pandemic based on science‚Äînot theories retweeted by Trump."
"We should ask ourselves, is health care a benefit that somehow we lose when we lose our jobs?

Or is it simply a human right that all of us deserve?"
"Racist redlining denied wealth to generations of Black Americans.
 
Today, the fossil fuel industry dumps its pollution on communities of color.
 
This comment from Trump‚Äôs Energy Secretary is disgusting."
"Since Day One, this president has thought he‚Äôs above the law, above criticism, and can get away with anything‚Äîincluding a fake ""emergency"" to sell bombs to Saudi Arabia.

It is becoming clear he fired an Inspector General for investigating such misconduct."
I happen to believe we should go in the direction of a paycheck security process which says to every worker in America: you will continue to receive your paycheck and benefits during this crisis.
"Why did Trump veto our bill to end the horrific U.S. role in Saudi Arabia's bombings of Yemeni children?

Because we have a president who puts Raytheon's profits ahead of human life.

It's time to rein in this corrupt White House and stop this war."
"If we have any sense of morality as a nation, we have got to worry about the 20% of kids who today face hunger and the older people who are isolated, not getting the food they need. Those must be our priorities."
No.
"We need to lift the burden of outrageous health care bills off the shoulders of working-class families.

Our approach is simple, efficient, and universal:

During this crisis, Medicare should cover all out-of-pocket health costs for everyone in America."
"While wealthy people quarantine in the luxury of their summer homes, low-income workers are being forced to go back to work and put their lives on the line.
 
This virus has grossly exposed the inequities of our economic system."
"$1,200 doesn't cut it. Congress must send a monthly $2,000 check to every person who needs it until this crisis is over."
"No one in this country should be afraid to go to the doctor because of cost amidst this horrific pandemic.

We must empower Medicare to pay all of the medical bills of the uninsured and the under-insured."
"Coronavirus has killed more than 85,000 people. Some 36 million workers have lost their jobs. Good thing President Trump is looking out for the real victims of the coronavirus: fossil fuel executives."
"These global leaders are right. As soon as an effective COVID-19 vaccine is approved it must be guaranteed to everyone‚Äînot just in the United States, but throughout the world. Let us put human lives ahead of corporate greed."
"At this week's Senate hearing, Trump administration officials repeatedly evaded my simple question. 

So I am once again asking: @SecAzar, when a COVID-19 vaccine is approved, will it be made available to everyone in America without cost?"
"Here is the bottom line: If we are to avoid another Great Depression, it is absolutely imperative that every worker in this country continues to receive a paycheck and benefits."
"These hungry American children cannot get the same nutrition support as kids in the continental United States.

It‚Äôs time to stop treating Puerto Rico like a colony. Our legislation makes adequate food assistance a right for all‚Äîincluding Puerto Ricans."
"Let me thank Speaker Pelosi for recognizing the enormity of the coronavirus crisis and coming up with a number of important proposals.

In my view, the Senate must improve this bill to adequately address two urgent needs: health care and economic security."
"In just eight weeks, 36 million Americans lost their jobs. 27 million lost their health insurance.

During the worst public-health crisis in a century, we cannot continue to tie health care to employment.

Medicare must guarantee health care to all."
"It is a moral outrage that during a deadly pandemic, 1 in 7 essential workers are uninsured.

Congress must empower Medicare to pay all health costs for every person in America during this crisis by passing the Health Care Emergency Guarantee Act."
"300 global lawmakers, @Ilhan, and I believe we need unprecedented compassion, solidarity and cooperation right now.

To prevent major increases in poverty and hunger, the World Bank and IMF must cancel debt and provide financial support to poorer nations."
"Today, @NydiaVelazquez and I introduce legislation to say: Millions are going hungry during this pandemic. The people of Puerto Rico must receive same help from the federal government as any state‚Äîperiod."
"Congratulations to the advocates fighting the Keystone XL pipeline!

If we believe a clean environment and indigenous rights matter more than Big Oil‚Äôs short-term profits, then rejecting this disastrous project is a no-brainer."
"How does it happen that Europe is facing the same pandemic, but has an unemployment rate that's just a fraction of ours?

It is time to adopt a simple, efficient, and cost-effective approach: Guarantee the paycheck of every worker in America."
"Who is suffering the most because of preconditions which laid them open to coronavirus‚Äîbecause they have not had the decent health care they‚Äôve needed? Disproportionately Black and brown people. 

This systemic racism must be addressed and ended."
Pretty pathetic. Mr. Trump is a coward who tears down others to make himself feel powerful.
"While the top 1% own twice as much wealth as the bottom 99% of humanity, 420 million people throughout the world are in danger of slipping into extreme poverty and 30 million children are at risk of dying from hunger. We cannot allow that to happen."
"How absurd is it that we have completely ignored the need to create an efficient unemployment system?

The establishment's contempt for working-class people is a sickness."
"Top oil and gas CEOs made $8,600 an hour in 2018‚Äîthey got in *nine minutes* what ordinary Americans got as a one-time $1,200 coronavirus check.

No, we do not need to bail out fossil fuel CEOs‚Äîwe need sustained, economic protection for working families."
"""We hate local, state, and federal governments, but we love Wall Street and big money!""

The crisis we face today is the result of 40 years of those kinds of attacks on government. 

It is time for all of us to reject that kind of thinking."
Happy Mother's Day to Jane and all the mothers of this country.
"With tens of thousands of Americans dying and millions losing their jobs, how sad it would be if we learned nothing from all that we have done wrong.
 
We must reassess the foundational institutions of American society and determine how we go forward into a better future."
"America has lost Little Richard, one of the inventors of rock and roll. He was a brilliant performer who broke down barriers and inspired millions of people around the world. Rest in peace."
"A $1,200 check ain't enough. We need $2,000 a month, per person, to make America's working families whole."
"20 million people lost their jobs last month. 

The American people do not want their health care tied to their employment.

They want Medicare for All."
".@RepPressley, @SenWarren and I call on Congress to act quickly to provide our country's Community Health Centers with the $77 billion in funding they need. CHCs are vital and irreplaceable, now more than ever."

"Millions of Americans don't know how they're going to pay for groceries, rent, utilities, or medicine.

Our legislation with @SenKamalaHarris and @SenMarkey provides every working family with $2,000 a month, per person, until this crisis is over:"
"This is an unprecedented economic crisis. We must act right away to:

‚ÄîKeep every employee on their payroll and guarantee their wages

‚ÄîProvide $2,000 a month to every working-class man, woman and child in America"
It is up to working people around the world to stand together to end the absurdity of spending trillions of dollars on war‚Äîwhile millions of children die from preventable diseases and billions of people live on pennies an hour.
"I congratulate the City Council of New Orleans for unanimously passing a resolution in support of Medicare for All!

We must continue to build this grassroots energy at every level‚Äîin cities, counties and states across America‚Äîto finally guarantee health care to all our people."
"If there has ever been a moment in American history when people understand the absurdity of tying health care to your job, now should be that moment.

Whether you're employed or not, 3 years old or 93, health care must be a human right for every man, woman and child in America."
"This is cronyism at its worst: A Postmaster General who has no experience delivering mail‚Äîjust huge campaign contributions to Trump.

We cannot let this president exploit a horrific pandemic to privatize the Postal Service or bust postal workers' unions."
"Trump said ‚Äúgreat nations do not fight endless wars,‚Äù and yet he has now vetoed two bipartisan War Powers Resolutions to keep us in those wars.

Congress must continue its efforts to rein in this lawless president."
"A Native American health center asked for medical supplies and got body bags instead.

Is this what America is about?

Native communities are in crisis with totally inadequate federal support. We must prioritize real tribal health care and economic aid."
This is a man-made crisis. The solution is straightforward: Congress must keep workers on payroll and guarantee their paychecks until the pandemic is over.
"To the nurses across America who are caring for our sick with unbelievable bravery and compassion: 

We stand with you. We will not stop fighting for the workplace safety, protective gear and the hazard pay you deserve. #NationalNursesDay"
"It is time for @realDonaldTrump to listen to the 92% of voters who want full federal funding for the Postal Service.

The Post Office is delivering medicine to millions of Americans during a pandemic. We will not allow it to be bankrupted or privatized."
"Outrageous. Instead of spending hundreds of millions of dollars on dividends to enrich wealthy shareholders, Caterpillar, Black &amp; Decker, Levi Strauss and other corporations should be using this money to compensate the thousands of workers they laid off."
"We must break away from the worldview that suggests everybody should try to become a billionaire‚Äîand you can lie, cheat, and steal if your goal is to make billions and not pay attention to the suffering of others."
"I will be damned if the federal government outsources more good-paying jobs in the middle of an economic meltdown.
 
We must not allow the Trump Administration to exploit this crisis and attack unions, slash wages, or destroy middle-class jobs."
"Did you receive a $1,200 stimulus check? If not, why?

If we provide working-class households with $2,000/month per family member during this pandemic, what would you do with it? 

What must Congress do now to protect you and your family? Share your story."
"Roughly 13% of all Americans struggle to stay fed. In the middle of a health and economic crisis, that number is much, much worse.

We have the resources to eliminate hunger. The question is, do we have the courage? Do we have the compassion?"
"The United States should be helping to bring the world together to develop a vaccine for this horrific pandemic.

Instead, under Trump‚Äôs ""leadership,"" we don‚Äôt even bother to show up."
"Jeff Bezos has seen his wealth go up by $34 billion since March 12th.

The least he could do is provide two weeks of universal paid sick leave and respect the right of workers to organize. I stand in solidarity with Amazon Workers International."
"There is no excuse for medical workers in the richest country on Earth to lack masks, gloves, gowns and tests.

If Trump won't act, Congress must. @RepRoKhanna and I are introducing legislation to rapidly manufacture all the medical equipment we need:"
There are legitimate questions we must ask about the Chinese government‚Äôs inability to contain the virus. But Pompeo‚Äôs incitement is a blatant effort to distract us from questions about Trump‚Äôs own disastrous failure.
"I said it in 1993 and I will say it again now: If you want a simpler, more cost-effective health care system, the way forward is a Medicare for All, single-payer program."
"When people stand up and say, ""I am a human being. This is what I deserve‚Äù‚Äîthat is the beginning of a political revolution."
"The Walton family is worth $165.7 billion. Do we really need to have families in America worth more than $100 billion? 

When half of our people live paycheck to paycheck? 

Let us, together, have the courage to take on the greed of the corporate elite."
"Thousands of medical workers are getting laid off and falling sick when we need them most.

Can a rational person argue our current ‚Äúsystem‚Äù makes any sense?

@RepJayapal and I believe it‚Äôs time to learn from this crisis and make health care a human right:"
"How the hell are Americans supposed to stay home safely when utility companies are shutting their water off?
 
We must restore service to families who've been disconnected, forgive all utility debt, and freeze future disconnections until this crisis ends."
"More than 30 million Americans have lost their jobs because of this horrific pandemic, yet they are still expected to cobble up enough income to pay the rent that is due today. That is unacceptable.

It is time to #CancelRent and 
#CancelMortgages until this crisis is over."
"Germany, Canada, France and the UK ensure that workers receive paychecks and benefits during this crisis.

It is not radical to expect that we join the rest of the advanced world and end the absurdity of millions of Americans losing their jobs every week."
"Minimum weeks of paid sick leave in Germany, France, Mexico and Japan: 52

United States: 0

I have been fighting for three decades to change that.

Maybe this global pandemic will revise our thinking a little bit."
"Millions of Americans are still waiting on their unemployment benefits.

"Pharmaceutical CEO salaries: 

Merck: $55 million
Pfizer: $50M
Eli Lilly: $30M
Johnson &amp; Johnson: $26M

Solution: Guarantee paychecks to workers and health care to all."
"Our 640,000 postal workers are heroes, toiling under very difficult conditions to provide lifesaving services for the people of this country.

Our job right now is to protect, expand and strengthen the Post Office. That means coming together to block Trump's privatization scheme."
"30 million lost their jobs in six weeks.

We are the only major country with millions unemployed and uninsured.

It's time to reexamine our society's foundations and fight for a more just nation.

This is the moment to make sure everyone has economic security and health care."
"Let‚Äôs treat essential frontline workers as heroes, not just call them heroes. Cancel student debt now."
"If the White House Gift Shop is going to produce $100 COVID-19 coins, Trump can sure as hell utilize the Defense Production Act to manufacture the gloves, gowns, and masks our medical workers desperately need."
"Israeli annexation of occupied territory clearly violates international law.

An outcome in which Palestinians are denied equality, freedom, and self-determination is an affront to our values and interests. It should not be supported by the United States."
"We have a president forcing hazardous meat plants to reopen, threatening workers' health.

We have a Labor Department siding with corporations over workers' safety.

Disgusting. Maybe this is too ""radical,"" but we need a White House that protects public health during a pandemic."
"We will not allow Donald Trump to:

- Destroy 630,000 good-paying jobs
- Eliminate thousands of post offices
- Close hundreds of mail sorting plants
- Privatize and dismantle the Postal Service

If we can bail out Boeing, we can save the Post Office."
"Pathetic. A payroll tax cut does nothing for the 26 million who lost their jobs. With rent due on May 1, we need to provide $2,000 a month to everyone until this crisis is over. If we can bail out corporations, we can make sure everyone has enough to pay for basic necessities."
"Amazon, Trader Joe‚Äôs and Berkshire Hathaway figured out a way to make this crisis even more horrific for workers: Union-busting.

If there were ever a time to stand against corporate greed and with workers fighting for their rights, that time is now."
"Trump wants to privatize the Postal Service over a personal grudge, using faulty data. Congress has got to stop him.

We must fully fund the Postal Service so it can continue to deliver medication, mail-in ballots, and other necessities to all Americans."
"Rather than subsidize the insurance industry's profits, we can pursue a simpler, cost-effective, and comprehensive solution for health care.

For the duration of this pandemic, Medicare should cover all out-of-pocket expenses for all Americans. Here's how:"
"Half a million people are sleeping on the streets.

15 million children live in poverty.

‚Öì of Americans lack adequate health care.

In my view, being a human being means you are entitled to a roof over your head, to a doctor and medicine, and to a dignified standard of living."
"The Trump Administration's failure to require everybody to wear masks in airports and airplanes will only lead to more sickness and death.

Flight attendants and airline workers should not be forced to put their lives and health at risk. Enough is enough."
"Doctors are getting fired as America faces the highest number of coronavirus deaths on Earth.

Who can still defend a health care ""system"" dominated by profit and greed?

It is time to do what the majority of our people want and establish a rational, Medicare-for-All program."
"How in the hell does Carnival, a cruise ship company that pays virtually no federal income taxes, receive a bailout, but the Postal Service, the most popular government agency in America, does not?

The Post Office is essential. Cruise ships are not."
Mental health care is a human right‚Äînow more than ever.
More than one out of every four doctors in America are immigrants. What an utter disgrace.
"$282,000,000,000.

That's by how much America‚Äôs billionaires increased their wealth in less than a month, while over 22 million lost their jobs.

This system of unfettered greed is morally obscene. It‚Äôs time to put working families first‚Äînot billionaires."
"Millions of families need federal help right now for the food, shelter, income, and health care they need.

The absolute last thing Congress should be doing is shoveling money to boost the profits of arms manufacturers like Lockheed and Raytheon."
"It is disgusting that Trump would exploit this pandemic to bust postal unions and privatize the most popular government agency in America.

If we can bail out large corporations, we can damn well save the Postal Service and protect these essential jobs."
"I find it reprehensible that Amazon is firing employees who speak out against unsafe working conditions during this horrific pandemic.

These workers will not be silenced."
"Leader McConnell: You cannot give $500 billion to bail out large corporations and then tell state governments to go bankrupt fighting this deadly pandemic.

Whatever that is, it is certainly not the leadership the American people want."
"Here's an idea for @JeffBezos: Instead of handing out t-shirts, maybe, as the richest man on Earth, you can provide all of your workers with paid sick leave, hazard pay, protective gear, and a safe and sanitary workplace."
Remember: we are still the only major country to not guarantee health care to all its people. We've got work to do.
"Republicans tucked in a $170 billion tax break for 43,000 people making over $1 million into coronavirus relief.

That's more than all aid for states and cities.

@RepLloydDoggett and @SenWhitehouse are right: We have got to repeal this obscene giveaway."
"Maybe‚Äîjust maybe‚Äîthe most essential people in our economy are not hedge fund managers.

Could it be that they are doctors, nurses, EMTs, grocery store workers, workers in drug stores, farm workers, and truck drivers?

Let us begin to rethink some of our priorities."
"More Black and Latino people are dying from coronavirus because air pollution is worse in their communities. That is unconscionable.

It is not a radical idea that clean air and water should be the right of all Americans regardless of income and skin color."
"Trump's Earth Day plans? Ignore science, exploit a pandemic to roll back environmental protections, and hand out favors to the fossil fuel industry.

Let us celebrate the 50th #EarthDay by standing together and tackling these crises head on."
"To prevent further economic collapse, Congress must make sure every worker in America keeps receiving his or her paycheck and benefits during this crisis."
"This pandemic is devastating the Navajo Nation, which already struggled with poverty, lack of running water and inadequate medical care.

Indigenous communities like the Navajo Nation cannot be neglected any longer. Congress must provide full federal support to make them whole."
We have trillions in funding for endless wars. We can damn well find the money to make sure our people are able to feed their families and pay their bills.
"I got involved in politics because I never again want to see humanity descend into the barbarity of the Holocaust.

On Holocaust Remembrance Day, let us recommit to the struggle we're all involved in to create a world where people love and care for each other."
"President Trump has failed to listen to science and we have all suffered because of it.

Let's be serious and prioritize our health over the bank accounts of billionaires and large corporations."
"Big Oil has proven that it cannot operate without causing health, environmental, and economic crises. 

Our job: Ensure that oil workers have health care, pay, and pensions as we rapidly transition away from fossil fuels."
"It makes no sense for young people to be denied jobs because they were arrested for smoking marijuana. It is time to legalize marijuana, expunge past marijuana convictions and end the failed war on drugs."
"A furloughed German worker retains 90-100% of his salary, while his American counterpart is struggling to obtain unemployment benefits.

Unacceptable. Congress must cover the paychecks of every U.S. worker."
"Tens of millions are being laid off. Over half our workers rely on their jobs for health care.

How does this make any damn sense?

Whether you're working or not, young or old, rich or poor, health care must be a human right‚Äînot a privilege or job benefit."
"American taxpayers put tens of millions of dollars into developing remdesivir. Any coronavirus treatment or vaccine must be made free for everybody.

We will not tolerate profiteering by Gilead or any other pharmaceutical corporation right now. Human life comes first."
"We spend $11,000 for every man, woman and child on health care‚Äîtwice that of other rich countries.

Yet 30 million are uninsured, thousands of health workers are losing jobs, and we lack basic medical equipment.

It is time for a rational, single-payer, Medicare for All system."
"Justice for frontline workers means childcare, safe conditions and $500 a week in hazard pay to:

"The American people deserve and require leadership from Washington that acts aggressively, puts working people first, and provides peace of mind to the most vulnerable people in our country.

We must act with love, compassion and urgency."
"We are the only wealthy country where millions are losing their jobs and health care at precisely the moment when they need them the most.

@MarkWarner, @SenDougJones, @SenBlumenthal and I have a plan to restore the wages and benefits of every rank-and-file worker in America:"
"Call me crazy, but I believe the richest country in the world has no business sacrificing the health of our essential workers. We need vigorous workplace safety enforcement, paid sick leave, free health care, and monthly $2,000 payments during this crisis."
"These ideas are not radical:

üè•Universal health care
üõåPaid sick leave for all
üë∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è$15 minimum wage and a union
üåèA livable planet for our kids
üë©üèΩ‚ÄçüéìFree preschool-to-graduate school education

We have got to open up people's imagination as to the kind of world they can be living in."
"One year ago today, Donald Trump vetoed our bipartisan legislation to end U.S. involvement in Saudi Arabia's brutal war in Yemen.

Now, as a pandemic threatens millions of Yemenis, the U.S. must finally say: Stop the bombings. Lift the blockade. Let food and medicine into Yemen."
"How to fix a shortage of medical masks during a crisis:

‚úÖ Utilize the Defense Production Act to make, buy and distribute masks

‚ùå Give $55 million to a bankrupt company that doesn‚Äôt actually make masks

Trump's corruption and incompetence are costing lives."
Cancel all student debt.
"Trump‚Äôs decision to cut funding to the World Health Organization‚Äîin the middle of a pandemic‚Äîendangers American lives. And his own officials know it.

This is a global crisis. We have got to strongly support multilateral institutions like the WHO to confront it."
"We are the only major country where millions of people are losing their jobs and health insurance during this pandemic. In my view, the solution is straightforward:

‚úîÔ∏è Keep workers on payroll and provide 100% of their wages
‚úîÔ∏è Treat health care as a right‚Äînot an employee benefit"
"People are spending most of their stimulus checks on food, medicine and other necessities. We have got to do a lot more.

Congress must now immediately authorize monthly payments of $2,000 to every person in America until this crisis is over."
"The Postal Service is:

üåéOur only universal delivery network
üë©‚ÄçüíºEmployer of 640,000 Americans
üì¶Deliverer of 1.2 billion packages of medicine a year
üéñLargest provider of jobs for veterans
üá∫üá∏Enshrined in the Constitution

We must save the Postal Service and protect its workers."
"Social distancing can be impossible for our homeless, who are among the most vulnerable during this pandemic.

We cannot talk about the necessity of staying at home if we are not committed to making housing a human right."
"$33.4 billion. That's how much the wealth of Jeff Bezos and six other billionaires increased last week while millions of Americans were filing for unemployment.

Our society cannot sustain itself when so few have so much, while so many have so little."
"Let me congratulate Sara Nelson and the flight attendants on their historic victory to ensure that 2 million airline workers receive their paychecks and benefits during this crisis.

Congress must now extend these protections to every worker in America."
"Chris Smalls organized Amazon warehouse workers to demand protective gear, paid sick leave, and workplace safety.

Rather than change its policies, Amazon fired him.

I say to Jeff Bezos: Enough! We will not tolerate CEOs who intimidate workers fighting for their human rights."
"Billionaire bankers just love socialism for the rich.

Greedy hedge fund managers are now calling themselves ""small businesses"" to apply for government handouts. That is wrong.

This aid is desperately needed to help Main Street, not Wall Street."
"Instead of firing employees who want justice, maybe Jeff Bezos‚Äîthe richest man in the world‚Äîcan focus on providing his workers with paid sick leave, a safe workplace, and a livable planet."
"We are looking today at doctors and nurses who can't acquire the masks they need as they put their lives on the line.

Yet we are the wealthiest country in the history of the world.

How does that happen?"
"Trump knows mail-in ballots mean a larger voter turnout, which he does not want to see.

That is pretty pathetic.

My colleagues and I are working as hard as we can to pass legislation so that as many people as possible can safely participate in our democracy."
"Leilani Jordan said she wasn't given gloves or hand sanitizer.
 
Now this grocery worker is dead at 27 over a $20.64 paycheck.
 
Is this what America is about? Or will we fight for protective gear, hazard pay, and paid sick leave for all frontline workers?"
"Even before this pandemic, a majority of our workers lived paycheck to paycheck.

1 in 7 children didn‚Äôt get enough to eat.

40% couldn‚Äôt afford a $400 emergency.

Let us learn from this crisis. Let us finally eradicate hunger and poverty in the richest country in human history."
"It is beyond insane that corporate hospital administrators gave nurses protective gear only after they were tested positive for coronavirus.

We need emergency labor standards and swift enforcement to protect our frontline medical workers NOW."
"We cannot allow Donald Trump to use this horrific pandemic as an opportunity to bankrupt and privatize the Postal Service. Now, more than ever, we need a strong and vibrant postal system to deliver mail 6-days a week. Congress must act now to save it."
"The idea that we treat health care as an employee benefit is totally absurd.

As millions are losing their jobs, my bill with @RepJayapal says: We will take a burden off your shoulders. In this crisis, you will get all the health care you need for free."
"It is absolutely outrageous that Donald Trump and Steve Mnuchin have still not approved grants included in the CARES Act to fully fund the paychecks and benefits of 2 million airline workers.

@stevenmnuchin1: Stop delaying these grants. Pay the airline workers now."
"My friend Rep. Tlaib is right. At a time when hand-washing is saving lives, no one should be denied water‚Äîperiod."
"If today we had the same level of inequality we had forty years ago, the bottom 90% of American households would be earning $12,000 more every year.

$120,000 per decade.

Do not tell me we cannot afford to cover the paychecks of every worker during this horrific pandemic."
"It is outrageous that in the richest country in the history of the world, people are going hungry. Congress must radically increase food assistance programs and offer grocery delivery options to ensure all people are able to eat safely during this crisis."
"LIVE: Please join my town hall on the coronavirus pandemic with @SenatorLeahy, @PeterWelch, and @GovPhilScott.

We are answering Vermonters' questions by phone and providing information on federal and state efforts to address this crisis:"
"How the hell are you supposed to wash your hands during a pandemic when your water has been shut off?

We must require utility companies to restore services to all who have been disconnected, and prohibit all new shutoffs until this crisis is over."
"To support the American people during this pandemic, Congress must:

üíµ Guarantee 100% of all workers' paychecks
üíä Empower Medicare to pay all out-of-pocket costs
üè¶ Provide $2,000 a month for all
ü§í Give paid sick leave to all workers
üè° Suspend rent and mortgage payments"
"This crisis makes clear what we have known for decades.

If we are sincere about the needs of ordinary Americans, we must pass a single-payer national program to guarantee health care for all Americans."
"The president is acting out of political self-interest during a pandemic.

I believe Congress must provide leadership instead. Here is how:"
"It is unacceptable that African Americans are getting sick and dying from the coronavirus at such disproportionately high rates.
 
We must solve the horrific racial disparities in health that we have in this country."
"Amazon workers have tested positive for coronavirus‚Äîwhich may live for up to 24 hours on cardboard‚Äîat 50 warehouses.

In my view, failures by Amazon to keep workers safe are not only putting their employees at risk. They place the entire country at risk."
"At a time when millions of people are losing their jobs and their health insurance, the United States government must guarantee that you will have all of the health care you need."
"During this pandemic, know your rights!

For mostrenters, you cannot be evicted or charged penalties for not paying rent.

For most homeowners, you can request a forbearance on your mortgage."
"We have got to do everything we can to make sure that right now, our people are safe, get the paychecks that they need, receive medical care for free, and have a roof over their heads.

All American workers must be made whole."
"Jason Hargrove‚Äôs death is an outrage‚Äîit should've never happened. Blue-collar workers are risking their lives to keep this country running. They deserve better.

The federal government must require that all frontline workers get protective gear NOW."
"This is an economic meltdown. Millions of Americans have no food in the pantry to feed their kids. No money for rent. Can't pay their mortgage, student debt, or medical bills.

We cannot say, ""Let's wait and see."" We need to get help to our people now and protect their wellbeing."
"It is insane that our nurses are being forced to care for the sick without masks and respirators. The Department of Labor must immediately issue emergency workplace standards to protect our health workers, their families, and their patients."
"It is incomprehensible that we have governors continuing to do business as usual rather than issue stay-at-home orders.

If they're not able to do it, the federal government should."
"During this emergency, the government should cover all of the health care you need‚Äîthat means no out-of-pocket expenses."
"While millions of Americans were waiting on unemployment benefits they were promised, Trump made time to meet with those suffering the most: Exxon and Chevron CEOs.

If you‚Äôre an oil executive who desperately needs a handout, don‚Äôt worry! The president is here to help."
"If our farmworkers fall ill, we go hungry. Our health and wellbeing are all interconnected.

We must put an end to their cramped, impoverished conditions, and provide free health care, paid sick leave, and good wages‚Äîregardless of immigration status."
"The sailors cheering for Captain Crozier are right.

The Navy appears to be retaliating against him for acting out of concern for his sailors' health. His position should be restored immediately.

Amidst this horrible pandemic, we must speak the truth and protect each other."
"If workers are considered essential enough to show up on the job during a pandemic, I'm pretty damn sure they're essential enough to have a $15-an-hour living wage, paid sick leave, protective equipment, and health care as a right."
"I support the flight attendants. The Trump Administration must stop putting up road blocks to this aid.

The airline grants must be immediately released to fully fund the paychecks and benefits of 2 million workers. Workers need help and they need it now."
"Congress passed the largest unemployment benefits expansion in history, but families like the Rodriguezes are going hungry waiting for help to arrive.

The federal government must assist every state and territory in America to get support out right away."
"What good is an order to shelter in place if you're homeless? This pandemic shows us that housing is in fact health care.

As a matter of public health and justice, we must end homelessness and provide shelter to 500,000 Americans sleeping on the street."
"Last week, 6.6 million applied for unemployment. Millions more will lose their jobs in the coming weeks. In the midst of this horrific crisis, Congress must pass a new, unprecedented emergency bill that guarantees income and health care for all Americans. Working on details now."
"The Labor Department's job now is to make sure millions of people get unemployment benefits immediately.

We must also join the UK, France and other countries to directly fund workers' wages and stop more layoffs.

We have got to tell our working families: You will be made whole."
"Number of people who have no health insurance:

Now, more than ever, we need a universal, Medicare for All, single-payer health care system."
"Half of our seniors survive on $25,000 a year or less.

Outrageously, Trump tried to make them jump through hoops during a pandemic to get their $1,200 emergency relief payment.

Thanks to strong pressure, Trump reversed this policy. Seniors will get the help they need right now."
"Today is #CensusDay, and I urge every person living in the United States to fill it out.

It is more important than ever that we participate in the Census and make sure funding for things like health care and nutrition support go to everybody who needs it:"
"Millions are losing their jobs and health care at a rate never before seen in American history.

@realDonaldTrump‚Äôs response? Block  from enrolling people who desperately need insurance during a pandemic.

That is insane."
"How can it be that we spend 18% of our GDP on health care‚Äîmore than any other major country on Earth‚Äîbut still lack the beds, masks, ventilators, gowns, gloves and test kits we need to adequately respond to this crisis?

We must transform our dysfunctional health care system."
"Our postal workers already had one of the most important jobs in America.

Now they are putting themselves at risk to deliver everything our country needs.

I am asking the Postal Service to do much, much more to protect their safety and wellbeing right now."
"This is an unprecedented moment in American history.

Our job is to mobilize this country to produce all the protective equipment our health workers need, ventilators for our sick, and free medical treatment for everybody."
"Coronavirus has killed 2,600 in Iran, but U.S. sanctions are obstructing medicine and aid from getting in.

@SecPompeo and @stevenmnuchin1: Pandemics know no borders. Let us put aside our countries' disputes and lift sanctions to reduce human suffering."
"Too many people are risking their lives showing up to work every day.

I stand with workers as they fight for their own safety.

Every employer in America must guarantee:

ü•Ω Protective gear
üßº Hand sanitizer and soap
‚ö†Ô∏è Hazard pay
üè≠ A safe, clean workplace
üõå Paid sick leave"
"In my view, during this crisis, nobody in America should have to worry about a medical bill. They‚Äôve got enough to worry about.

Right now, our goal must be to protect every single one of our people and ensure that their basic right to health care is taken care of."
"Workers at Amazon warehouses, Whole Foods grocery stores and Instacart food delivery do some of the most important jobs in America.

These wealthy corporations must give them the paid sick leave, safe workplaces, and protective gear they are demanding."
"I stand with GE‚Äôs workers who are calling on the company to convert its factories to produce ventilators.
 
No more layoffs, outsourcing, and tax dodging, @generalelectric. Put Americans to work manufacturing the life-saving ventilators we need."
"Today is #NationalDoctorsDay. Men and women in the medical profession are literally putting their lives on the line to protect the American people. 

We have an immense amount of gratitude. You are the heroes and heroines of our country today. Thank you."
"Throughout history, authoritarian leaders have used moments of crisis to seize unchecked power. Hungary‚Äôs Orban is the latest example. Now more than ever we must stand up for democracy and rule of law."
"The American people increasingly understand that now is the time to think boldly and act decisively.

We must move rapidly to a Medicare for All, single-payer system that treats health care as a human right."
"This should not be happening in the United States of America.

In the richest country in the world, our physicians and nurses must have the protective equipment they need to protect their own lives so that they can continue protecting the American people."
We are the only major country not to guarantee paid medical leave‚Äîthat is beyond pathetic. We need to provide it for every worker in America.
"Palestinians in Gaza already faced hardship under a blockade. Now they're dealing with the coronavirus.

My Senate colleagues and I call on Trump to send U.S. medical relief. And the Israeli government must also lift its restrictions on humanitarian aid."
"Working families could face a 40% increase in their premiums as they‚Äôre dealing with this pandemic.

America's for-profit insurance industry is not compatible with health care as a human right. 

Now is not the time for greed. Now is the time for Medicare for All."
How do the geniuses at Trump‚Äôs EPA respond to Americans dealing with a deadly respiratory disease? They allow power plants and factories to spew even more air pollution! Absolutely obscene.
"I think the American people are united on this: We need policies now which benefit the working families of this country, that benefit low-income people, that benefit the most vulnerable."
"It is an outrage that debt collectors are garnishing wages and Social Security checks for unpaid medical bills and student loans.

We must cancel all medical and student debt‚Äîand stop all debt collection right now.

A pandemic is not a time for greed."
"This bill was far from perfect, and we must go much further. But Democrats did a good job standing up to Trump and McConnell to make sure this relief package got help to workers, small businesses, hospitals, and states and cities that desperately need it."
"We will not tolerate our people going bankrupt to get treated for coronavirus or any other damn illness.

We need Medicare for All."
"In the midst of this economic downturn goal, the goal right now must be for the government to make whole and protect all of the working families in this country."
"We must not forget that 27,000 young Dreamers work as doctors, nurses, paramedics, pharmacists, and other health providers as we are fighting the coronavirus pandemic.

We have got to stand with them and block Trump's insane effort to end the DACA program."
"Right now, phone lines of unemployment offices around the country are jammed and websites are crashing.

The stimulus package just passed can provide real help to millions, but it won't matter unless the federal bureaucracy is able to implement the program and get the money out."
"Our hospitals are getting overwhelmed. Our medical workers can't get basic protective gear.
 
@realDonaldTrump: It is immoral to delay any longer. Enforce the Defense Production Act to immediately produce and distribute the masks, gloves, gowns, and ventilators we need."
"In a rational society, an extremely contagious, deadly virus would get our government to finally pass universal paid sick leave for workers.

Why hasn‚Äôt it happened yet? The power of big money over our politics."
"My Republican colleagues had no problem voting for a trillion dollars in tax breaks for billionaires and large corporations.

But‚Äîhorrors of horrors!‚Äîpoor workers might get a few bucks more in unemployment in the midst of a terrible crisis. Oh my god, the universe is collapsing!"
"If you lose your job, you shouldn't lose your health care. That is why we are fighting for Medicare for All."
"We had a bit of a debate last night when some of my anti-worker Republican colleagues tried to prevent low-income people from getting additional unemployment support.

I was not going to allow that to happen."
"Who on earth could have predicted that dismantling the White House pandemic office and cutting the Centers for Disease Control might leave us unprepared for this crisis?

Pretty much everybody."
"We are looking at an unprecedented crisis in American history.

The good news: Last night's bill expands unemployment benefits in a way that has never taken place before.

We will still need to go much further, and address working people's needs in a far more substantial way."
"In this crisis, what the American people want is for us to use our taxpayer dollars in every way that we can to protect the working families of this country and the 50 percent of Americans who are living paycheck to paycheck, not just the billionaires and large corporations."
"It is enormously dangerous to ignore medical experts and try to bring people back to work who may be sick.

Our first priority must be to protect the health of the American people.

Money is just money. Life is life."
"I worry very much what the coronavirus will do, particularly in Yemen, where the U.S.-backed Saudi war has put millions on the brink of starvation.

Let us use the five-year anniversary of this horrific conflict to end our military involvement. Yemen needs peace, not U.S. bombs."
"Unless Republican Senators drop their objections to the coronavirus legislation, I am prepared to put a hold on this bill until stronger conditions are imposed on the $500 billion corporate welfare fund."
"It is beyond belief that our health workers are putting their own lives on the line‚Äîrisking infection‚Äîto care for the American people.

We need the masks, gloves, gowns and workplace protections to keep health workers, their patients, and families safe."
"When Jonas Salk developed the polio vaccine 65 years ago, he understood its tremendous benefit to all of humanity and he refused to patent it.

Today, we must put human life above corporate profit. Any coronavirus treatment must be made free for everyone."
"Enough with the damn lies, @realDonaldTrump. Listen to the scientists. Millions of lives are at stake."
"Share of workers at major corporations without paid sick leave:

Sonic: 94%
Applebee's: 89%
Pizza Hut: 88%
Burger King: 86%
Subway: 86%
Domino's: 85%
Dunkin' Donuts: 85%
Wendy's: 84%
McDonald's: 78%
Chick-fil-A: 78%
Taco Bell: 77%

We must make paid sick leave a right for all."
"It is insane and unacceptable that the Trump Administration has given the Gilead pharmaceutical corporation a seven-year monopoly on a potential coronavirus treatment.

We will not tolerate profiteering. Any treatment or vaccine must be made free for all."
Congress must act in an unbelievably aggressive way to tell all workers: You will be made whole. You will get 100% of your paycheck.
"Absurdly, in the middle of a pandemic, Trump is fighting in the courts to end:

üë®üèΩ‚Äç‚öïÔ∏èGuaranteed coverage for preexisting conditions
üè•Emergency care
üíâFree federally recommended vaccines

Today is the ten-year anniversary of the ACA, and I will be damned if we let Trump repeal it."
"The consequences of the coronavirus on people already suffering from war are truly unimaginable.

Humanity should end its conflicts and killing right now, and come together to save lives.

The United States can and must play a leading role in bringing about a global ceasefire."
"As corporate CEOs come asking the government for welfare checks, and Senate Republicans arrange for a $500 billion slush fund for them, Congress must stand firm: No stock buybacks allowed for companies seeking bailouts."
This is truly outrageous. Congress needs to be working urgently to protect the health of the American people‚Äînot threatening the health care of millions of low-income people.
"Reading the Republican coronavirus bill, you'd think the most important people in America are corporate CEOs. That is wrong.

Our essential workers include:
üë©‚Äç‚öïÔ∏èHealth workers
üööDelivery and warehouse workers
ü•óFood workers
üë∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èTransit workers

We must put their needs ahead of CEOs."
"It is a disgrace that our nurses at the frontlines of this pandemic don't have basic protective gear. If they get sick, what happens to our health system?

The Department of Labor must issue emergency protection standards for all our health care workers."
The job of Congress right now is to do everything we possibly can to protect Americans' lives and wellbeing‚Äînot hand out welfare checks to huge corporations.
"Senate Republicans' partisan coronavirus package is outrageous:

‚ùåCreates a slush fund for corporate bailouts
‚ùåDoes nothing to protect patients from huge bills
‚ùåDenies millions of workers paid sick leave
‚ùåKeeps state and local governments underfunded 

We must do much better."
"Community health centers are at the frontlines of this pandemic, providing health care to nearly 30 million low-income people.

More than 160 lawmakers and I are demanding billions in additional funding so these centers have all the supplies, staff, and equipment they need."
"States are competing to buy medical masks that went from $0.58 to $7 a piece.

We cannot tolerate price-gouging in the middle of this pandemic.

The president must immediately use the Defense Production Act to order companies to make the protective gear our health workers need."
"When workers are laid off, they lose their employer-provided health insurance.

That is why we need a universal, single-payer system that guarantees health care as a right to all our people.

That is why we need Medicare for All."
"$34,927.43.

That is the medical bill an uninsured patient got for being tested and treated for the coronavirus.

This is not the time for obscene profits or price-gouging.

Right now we must make health care free‚Äîincluding for the 30 million uninsured."
"Our delivery workers are doing some of the most important jobs in the country right now.

Why the hell aren't they getting the hand sanitizer, protective gear, and paid sick leave they need?

This should not be happening in the United States of America."
"Every country on earth is going to be affected by the coronavirus.

We are all in this together. We must work together.

If there was ever a moment to show each other unprecedented love, compassion, and solidarity, this is that moment."
"In the richest country in world history, our medical workers do not even have the masks, gloves, ventilators and protections they need right now.

We need to fundamentally change the dysfunctionality, stupidity and irrationality of the current system."
"The Senate GOP's plan to send checks will ignore many of our neediest:

A couple making $150K‚Äî$2,400
A senior getting $18K from Social Security‚Äî$600
Undocumented parents with citizen children‚Äî$0
Someone living off disability payments‚Äî$0
A student in 2018 who just got laid off‚Äî$0"
"In this crisis, we have got to pay more attention to the most vulnerable. Mothers are skipping meals to feed their kids right now. Who‚Äôs going to respond to them?

We must guarantee the health, nutrition, shelter, and economic wellbeing of all our people."
"If the Federal Reserve can inject a trillion and a half dollars into the banking system, then Congress can say to the American people: ""We have got your back. If you lose your job, then you will not lose income. You will be made whole."" #saveworkers"
"Lives are at stake. Trump must start taking this national emergency seriously.

Without delay, we need to use the Defense Production Act to mass produce and distribute urgently needed medical equipment to every state and territory in America."
"As people are getting laid off and families are worried about their next meal, it is truly beyond my comprehension why the Trump Administration is fighting to kick 700,000 people off nutrition assistance in the middle of this pandemic."
"The majority of Amazon's 800,000 workers are working in warehouses and are worried about their safety.

We should ask Jeff Bezos, the world's richest man, if he can afford to guarantee paid sick leave, hazard pay and safe conditions to all of his workers."
"In the richest country on earth, our health care workers are facing shortages of the basic tools they need to fight this pandemic.

We must immediately ramp up American manufacturing to make the testing kits, ventilators, protective gear, and other lifesaving equipment we need."
"I voted for this coronavirus bill, a step in the right direction. As Congress drafts new legislation, we must go much further. For example, we need free health care and paid sick leave for all. Our job is to protect, at all cost, the health and economic safety of every American."
"Iran is facing a catastrophic toll from the coronavirus pandemic. U.S. sanctions should not be contributing to this humanitarian disaster.
 
As a caring nation, we must lift any sanctions hurting Iran‚Äôs ability to address this crisis, including financial sanctions."
"The coronavirus crisis is on a scale of a major war. We need:

üè•Testing and health care for all
üíµDirect economic aid to every worker
üè°No evictions, foreclosures or utility shutoffs
üè≠U.S. production of medical supplies

Now is the time for solidarity. We are in this together."
"Corporate America's refusal to provide paid sick leave to workers is not only inhumane‚Äîit is deadly.

Congress must guarantee paid medical leave to every worker in America as a right."
"Trump and his allies are stoking anti-Chinese bigotry in response to the coronavirus pandemic.

We cannot tolerate this kind of racism‚Äîespecially at this moment.

This crisis requires our political leadership to unite our country, not divide us up."
"Let's be clear‚Äîany rescue of the airlines must put workers first. That means:

‚úîÔ∏èPaying all workers at least $15 an hour
‚úîÔ∏èEnding stock buybacks
‚úîÔ∏èNo outsourcing jobs
‚úîÔ∏èExpanding benefits
‚úîÔ∏èWorkers sitting on corporate boards

We cannot repeat the failures of the last bailout."
"The coronavirus reminds us that we are all in this together. These commonsense measures are critical to stopping the spread of the disease and protecting our most vulnerable people.

It is absolutely essential that we start applying these practices in our daily lives right now."
"Here's a radical idea: We should prioritize the health and economic wellbeing of our people‚Äîseniors, workers and small-business owners, children, and our most vulnerable community members‚Äîover welfare checks and bailouts for corporate CEOs and bankers on Wall Street."
"I have consistently voted against the unconstitutional surveillance of Americans under the Patriot Act.

Today's bill does not do nearly enough to rein in out-of-control spying powers.

I stand with my Senate colleagues on both sides of the aisle who demand stronger reforms."
"Lack of health care does not just threaten the wellbeing of the uninsured‚Äîit affects us all.

This crisis is teaching us that we are only as safe as our least-insured and most vulnerable people.

We must join the rest of the industrialized world and guarantee paid sick leave to every single worker in America."
"In the midst of a major healthcare and economic crisis, we must recognize our common humanity and guarantee healthcare to all of our people‚Äîas a human right, not a privilege."
"Amazon paid $0 in taxes on $11 billion in annual profits. But it asks workers to ‚Äúdonate‚Äù their paid leave to others who are sick.

Workers and taxpayers are expected to be generous. Corporate CEOs‚Äîeven during a pandemic‚Äîcan be as stingy as they want."
"When Trump tells people to ""listen to their doctors,"" we must not forget: 1 out of every 4 Americans do not have a primary care physician.

In the midst of this crisis, we must provide everyone‚Äîregardless of income‚Äîwith all of the health care they need without cost."
"This incompetent administration‚Äôs response to the coronavirus has threatened the lives and health of many people.

Congress must immediately ensure that everyone who needs coronavirus testing and treatment gets it without ever having to open their wallet."
"The business model of the pharmaceutical industry:

1. Use taxpayer-funded research
2. Get patent monopolies on treatment
3. Charge any price they want

This is a racket that is literally killing people, and it must end.

Now is not the time for profiteering or price gouging."
"When we say it's time to provide health care to all our people, we're told we can't afford it.

But if the stock market is in trouble, no problem! The government can just hand out $1.5 trillion to calm bankers on Wall Street."
"The annual Pentagon budget is $738,000,000,000.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is 1.5% the size.

If we can find money on bombs and missiles to kill people, we can damn well afford to protect everyone's health and take care of each other."
"Millions of Americans are working for 11 or 12 bucks an hour.
 
They can't afford childcare.
They can't afford health care.
They're scared to death about their retirement.
 
They want a government that represents them, not just billionaires and large corporations."
"We are dealing with a president who has not read or does not understand the Constitution.

Today, the House and the Senate spelled it out for him: Mr. Trump, Congress will not allow you to start an illegal, immoral, and disastrous war against Iran."
"No one in America should have to go to work sick just to make ends meet.

Our coronavirus response must mean joining the rest of the industrialized world to guarantee paid sick leave for all."
"I stand with St. Paul teachers striking for good pay, benefits, and more resources for students.

Our teachers should be the best-paid in the industrialized world, not among the worst-paid.

We must change our national priorities and invest in education."
"As millions of workers struggle without sick pay and as seniors deal with unaffordable medical bills, President Trump is working overtime to protect the real victims of the coronavirus: fossil fuel executives."
"Sara Fearrington works double shifts, $7.40 an hour, no vacations, $28.42 in savings, facing eviction.

53 million low-wage workers like her are struggling on $18,000 a year.

We need a $15 minimum wage and unions to guarantee a dignified life in America."
"As a nation, we cannot effectively respond to the coronavirus when 30 million Americans lack health insurance.

We are all in this together. We need Medicare for All."
"How insane is this? We tell young people to get the best education they can, and then saddle them for decades with crushing loan debt.

It is not a ""radical idea"" to tax Wall Street, make public colleges and universities tuition-free, and cancel $1.7 trillion in student debt."
"Do we think American democracy is about a couple of wealthy billionaires putting hundreds of millions of dollars into campaigns without disclosure?

Is that the democracy Americans fought and died for in war after war?

I think not."
"We are facing a public health crisis. We must: 

üè• Reverse cuts to local public health agencies and Centers for Disease Control
üë©üèΩ‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è Provide full federal funding for all testing and treatment for the coronavirus
üõå Guarantee paid sick leave to every worker"
"When Danny Crespo took his own life, he was making $10 an hour, on Medicaid, unable to afford medicine and facing insane hospital bills.

We are fighting for Medicare for All so that no one else suffers the senseless pain and indignities he did in the richest country on earth."
"The richest 1% of America's families took in 48% of all income growth over the last 25 years.

We must reverse this obscene inequality. We need:

‚úÖFair trade, not corporate trade
‚úÖ$15 minimum wage
‚úÖStrong unions and worker ownership
‚úÖTaxes‚Äînot handouts‚Äîfor huge corporations"
"""I worry I will run out of food."" Listen to this mother describe what it's like to live on $7.65 an hour. 

I know a $15 minimum wage is radical to Republicans.

You know what‚Äôs radical? That people working 40 or 50 hours a week live in poverty."
"We cannot just hope businesses will do the right thing.

@realDonaldTrump: Support paid sick leave legislation for every worker in America."
"NAFTA did not just destroy 1 million American jobs‚Äîit forced millions of Mexican family farmers off their land and fueled a migration crisis.

We need a humane immigration system. But we must also end the disastrous corporate trade deals that have devastated Latin America."
"Women must have full control over their reproductive health. They must have equal pay for equal work: the whole damn dollar, not 79 cents on the dollar.

We will not go backward. We will go forward. Let us celebrate #InternationalWomensDay with a pledge to defend women's rights."
"At the end of the day, it is not necessarily true that building more guns, tanks, and missiles is the only way we will be safe.

We will be safer when people around the world get to know each other and understand the humanity they have in common."
"Bloody Sunday inspired Congress to pass the Voting Rights Act.

Outrageously, this historic civil rights law has been gutted by the Supreme Court.

But this will not stand. Those who risked their lives in Selma showed when people stand together for justice, nothing is impossible."
"Alec Smith died trying to pay for a century-old drug that cost $6 to make and sold at $300.
 
This is not a policy debate. It is a fight against the incredible corporate power of the pharmaceutical industry that is literally killing our people."
"My Republican friends tell us the only way we can ""strengthen Social Security'' is, in fact, to cut Social Security.

Nonsense!

Seniors cannot make it on $13,000 a year. When we talk about strengthening Social Security, that means increasing benefits, not cutting them."
"The Trump administration‚Äôs response to the coronavirus is a disgrace.

Our nurses on the frontlines of this crisis must have the protective gear, the safety protocols, and testing they need to care for our people."
"The science is clear: toxic PFAS ‚Äúforever chemicals‚Äù are a danger to our health. Congress must pass my PFAS Act to:

‚úì Hold corporate polluters like DuPont accountable
‚úì Fund drinking water cleanup
‚úì Ban PFAS in food packaging
‚úì Stop PFAS air pollution"
"The Walton family is America's wealthiest family. Net worth: $201 billion.

Walmart pay their workers starvation wages. Many are forced to go on Medicaid, food stamps, and public housing. Who pays for that? The middle class.

That is what corporate welfare is all about."
"Mass incarceration‚Äîin which we lock up far more people than any other country on Earth‚Äîis an inhumane policy which has completely failed. 

We must invest in affordable housing, education and jobs, not more jails and incarceration."
"Childhood poverty costs at least $500 billion annually in extra education, health and criminal justice expenses, and in lost productivity.

Just think of all of the intellectual and emotional destruction that takes place in America because we ignore the needs of our children."
"Seniors on Medicare earn $26,200 a year but spend $5,500‚Äî20% of their income‚Äîon out-of-pocket health costs.

Medicare for All changes that. We ease the burden on our seniors by covering:

‚úÖ Hearing
‚úÖ Dental
‚úÖ Vision
‚úÖ Home care
‚úÖ All prescription drug costs over $200 a year"
"Why are we the only major country on earth not to guarantee paid sick leave to our workers?

We shouldn't need a global pandemic to recognize that an injustice against low-wage workers is an injustice to us all."
"We have a president today who not only thinks climate change is a hoax, but has officials meddling with scientific reports to argue that carbon pollution might actually be good for us.

Trump's lies are a threat to a decent life for our kids and grandkids."
"I stand with activists today who are telling the Supreme Court: Do not side with Louisiana in its war against women.

We must keep fighting until the constitutional right to an abortion is secure."
"Under Trump, billionaires saw their wealth grow by $850 billion.

At the exact same time, over 114,000 more infants, toddlers and preschoolers became uninsured.

We need to be taking care of our children, not handing out corporate welfare to billionaires."
"I remember talking to a young woman in Vermont who left medical school with $300,000 in debt. 

Her crime? She wanted to become a doctor and work with low-income people.

She shouldn‚Äôt be punished with a debt of $300,000. College indebtedness is a horror."
"The women of this country have the right to control their own bodies, not politicians. 

Instead of defunding Planned Parenthood, we should expand it so that every woman in this country gets the health care she needs."
"How can we possibly pay for tuition-free public colleges, universities and trade schools for every person in America?

We could do it‚Äîeasily‚Äîwith the more than $70 billion that Congress added to Trump's Pentagon budget this year compared to under President Obama."
"Trump‚Äôs budget to Congress makes annual funding cuts of:

$167,000,000 to Health Preparedness
$175,000,000 to Centers for Disease Control
$3,000,000,000 to National Institutes of Health

But I‚Äôm sure the American people will be just overjoyed by this generous $100,000 donation."
"American companies have to worry about paying thousands of dollars a year on health insurance for each employee.
 
Medicare for All covers everyone. That means more people can start new businesses, manufacturing can be more competitive, and companies can invest in their workers."
"Jane and I send our deepest condolences to the families of those whose lives were lost to the severe storms and tornadoes in Tennessee.

The federal government must do everything it can to help rescue those missing or harmed and rebuild these communities."
"The U.S. government put a family in mandatory isolation. Now they're left with a $3,900 surprise hospital bill.

Profiting during an outbreak is not only cruel‚Äîit threatens public health. All needed tests, treatment, and vaccines must be made free for all."
"Thousands of earthquake survivors have been sleeping outdoors for months and many can't afford to repair their homes.

Trump's FEMA response is completely unacceptable. We can no longer tolerate the treatment of Puerto Ricans as second-class citizens."
"When I voted against the Gulf War in 1991, I thought I'd have a very short political career.

Today, I am proud to help lead bipartisan efforts in Congress to stop endless war.

Our job is to bring progressives and conservatives together to defeat the military industrial complex."
"Under our profit-driven system, the wealthy can buy vaccines. The poor or working class may get sick or even die.

Protecting the health of the American people means taking care of everyone‚Äîincluding our most vulnerable.

We need Medicare for All."
"In 1973, public college tuition, room and board cost $8,200 a year. Today it's $22,000.

Wages hardly grew, college costs nearly tripled.

It's time to treat higher education, like K-12 schooling, as a right. We must make public colleges tuition free and cancel all student debt."
"More than 13 million American children live in poverty.

Our childhood poverty rate is among the highest of any major country on Earth.

In my view, we should feed the children first, educate the children first, and worry about the military-industrial complex later."
"I find it amusing that Mr. Trump postures as a critic of this country's establishment. He got a $200,000 allowance as a kid, enjoys golfing with the rich and powerful, and gives billions upon billions in tax breaks to the world's largest corporations."
"It is not a radical idea to say that in the richest country in the world, when Americans turn on their taps, their drinking water should be safe to drink. The polluters must pay to end toxic PFAS contamination of our water across the country."
"Thank you to the American Medical Student Association @AMSANational for endorsing our College for All Act to cancel student debt and make college tuition-free.

American doctors should not have mountains of debt looming over them while they work to heal the sick and injured."
"Over the last 30 years, the establishment has pushed unfettered free trade which says to American workers:

You now need to compete against somebody in China who makes $1.50/hour.

If you don‚Äôt like it, we are going to move our plant to China.

Do we think that is right? I don‚Äôt."
"I am proud to have stood with working people to stop efforts to cut and privatize Social Security over the years.

Social Security is the most successful government program in our nation's history.

Our job is to protect it and expand it."
How do the drug companies get away with charging Americans the highest prices for prescription drugs on Earth? Maybe it's because there are two Big Pharma lobbyists for every member of Congress.
"Senator McConnell: Do not play politics with our response to the coronavirus. Congress has an obligation to end unconstitutional mass surveillance.

No administration, and especially not this administration, can be allowed to have the unchecked power to spy on Americans."
"100,000 Americans die every year from air pollution.

100 super-polluters spew one-third of America's toxic emissions, harming poor communities the most.
 
Corporate polluters must be required to foot the bill to clean up our air and save American lives."
"The coronavirus reminds us that we are all in this together. We cannot allow Americans to skip doctor's visits over outrageous bills.

Everyone should get the medical care they need without opening their wallet‚Äîas a matter of justice and public health."
"If we stay on our current track, children today will have a lower standard of living than their parents. It is the American dream in reverse.

Is it such a ""radical"" idea to say that every American has the right to a quality education, a living wage and health care?"
"In America, 59% of our uninsured are people of color.

Black mothers are three times likelier to die in childbirth as white mothers.

My friend @RepJayapal is right: Medicare for All helps advance racial justice and provides comprehensive care to everyone."
"In America today, CEOs get unlimited tax breaks on billions in savings, while working people struggle to retire.

We will end this $15-billion giveaway to corporate executives to use those funds to protect the pensions of 1.7 million blue-collar workers."
"Hundreds of thousands of Americans, convicted of nothing, are in jail because they can't afford cash bail‚Äîand Wall Street has been profiting from their incarceration. 

What a disgrace. Poverty is not a crime. Abolish cash bail."
"Instead of giving tax breaks to billionaires, let us invest in education, pay every teacher at least $60,000, and create the best school system in the world.
 
I want people to proudly say: ""I'm going to do one of the most important jobs in America: teaching our next generation."""
"Trump's plan for the coronavirus so far:

-Cut winter heating assistance for the poor
-Have VP Pence, who wanted to ""pray away"" HIV epidemic, oversee the response
-Let ex-pharma lobbyist Alex Azar refuse to guarantee affordable vaccines to all

Disgusting."
We must raise the minimum wage to a living wage. But don't just take it from me. Take it from these Patriotic Millionaires.
"40 years ago, more than 25% of all workers belonged to a union. Today: only 10%.

The decline of the American middle class over the past forty years is no coincidence.

We must rebuild the labor movement and make it easier, not harder, for workers to join unions."
"Nearly 1 million refugees‚Äînearly half of them children‚Äîare under threat as Syrian troops advance on Idlib.
 
The United States must work urgently with the UN to achieve a ceasefire and ensure full access for humanitarian assistance."
"I don't think you have to be a Ph.D. in infrastructure‚Äîa fancy word for roads, bridges, rail and water systems‚Äîto know our infrastructure is in quite bad shape.

Why do we spend trillions on never ending wars but can't afford to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure?"
"In the capital of the world's richest country, Black mothers die at a higher rate than in Panama or Ecuador. That is obscene.

Medicare for All means means comprehensive prenatal care, professional child delivery, and reproductive health services for all."
"If a bank is too big to fail, it is too big to exist. No single financial institution should be so large that its failure would cause catastrophic risk to millions of Americans, to our nation‚Äôs economic well-being, and to the global economy."
"It is a horror beyond words that Shane Patrick Boyle died because he fell $50 short of raising the money he needed for insulin.

Insulin was discovered in 1923 and was sold for $1. No one should beg, ration, go bankrupt, or die over it.

This is why we are taking on Big Pharma."
"I applaud Vermont's lawmakers, grassroots organizers, working families and progressive businesses, who came together to override this outrageous veto and give 40,000 Vermonters a raise.

This is the energy we need to guarantee that every worker in America earns a living wage."
"91 of America's richest corporations paid $0 in taxes on $100 billion in profits.

40% of America can't afford a $400 emergency.

What Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. said in 1968 is just as true today: This country has socialism for the rich and rugged individualism for the poor."
"Real change never takes place from the top on down. It takes place from the bottom on up, when people stand up and fight for justice."
"Medicare for All means businesses will not have to worry about how to provide health care for their employees. 

Workers will not be trapped in jobs to keep decent insurance. Instead, they will be able to pursue the work they love, which could be an enormous boon for the economy."
"Instead of selling $3 billion in weapons to enrich Raytheon, Boeing and Lockheed, the United States should be partnering with India to fight climate change.

We can work together to cut air pollution, create good renewable energy jobs, and save our planet."
"Fossil fuel CEOs want no federal regulations and billions of dollars in federal subsidies a year.

Our agenda is exactly the opposite: Kick Big Oil executives off of corporate welfare and regulate their planet-threatening carbon pollution out of existence."
"‚úÖ No more premiums.

‚úÖ No more co-payments.

‚úÖ No more deductibles.

‚úÖ No more out-of-control prescription drug prices.

Medicare for All means significant reductions in health care costs for American families."
"What Dr. King's extraordinary vision was all about was building a beloved community.

Our job is to bring people of all backgrounds together and create a compassionate society in which every single one of us can live with dignity."
"Three people own more wealth than half of America.

13 million people are working two or three jobs to make ends meet.

That is going to change when we make corporate America put workers on corporate boards and have a share in their companies' profits."
"The richest 400 Americans own $2.9 trillion‚Äîthe size of the entire UK economy.

These 400 billionaires pay a lower tax rate than the half of Americans living paycheck to paycheck.

The rich have waged 45 years of class war. It‚Äôs about time working people stand up and fight back."
"A three-letter word is blocking the Senate from passing common-sense gun legislation: the NRA.

I wear the D- grade they gave me for my voting record as a badge of honor."
"People may say, ""Oligarchy has to do with developing countries. What does it have to do with us?""

Well, it has everything to do with the United States of America, because that is the direction in which we are moving."
"DuPont knowingly dumped poisons in our water for decades. The victims are children like Abigail Herrmann who are drinking ""forever chemicals"" across America.

Congress must pass my PFAS Act to hold corporate polluters accountable for cleaning up this mess."
"$106 billion in profits. $0 in taxes. That's 91 of America's richest corporations.

By taking on the very wealthy, the billionaire class, and large multinational corporations, we will raise the funds to provide the services that will give dignity to working families in America."
"The wealthiest top 1% owe 70 percent of unpaid taxes. If we collected less than a third of that, we could pay for universal nutritious school meals for children.

Do not tell me kids have to go hungry at school in the richest country in the world."
"There will no real social progress in this country unless we have the courage to take on Wall Street, the insurance companies, the drug companies, the military-industrial complex, the fossil fuel industry, the prison industry and all the other forces of greed."
"It makes no sense for young people to be denied jobs because they were arrested for smoking marijuana. It is time to legalize marijuana, expunge past marijuana convictions and end the failed war on drugs."
"Our current system has forced people to pay for:

$100,000 ambulance ride to the closest hospital
$540,000 kidney dialysis
$10,000 out-of-network doctor charge at an in-network hospital 

Medicare for All ends this insanity.

Health care is a human right."
"Methane emissions that fuel climate change are much larger than we thought.

This is a moral issue. We must ban fracking‚Äîwhich harms our air, water and health. We can create millions of good jobs transforming our energy system to save our planet."
"Despite President Trump's constant support for big polluters, solar energy is making huge advancements.

Solar power is getting cheaper and cheaper, saving families money on utility bills and creating hundreds of thousands of American jobs."
"The American people want to know: If we could bail out the crooks on Wall Street, how come we can't protect working class families and enable their kids to get a college education?"
"Three people own more wealth than the bottom half of America.

Half our people live paycheck to paycheck.

500,000 people are sleeping in the streets.

We must stand up to the greed of large corporations and stand with working families. I make no apologies for that."
"1 in 7 kids will go hungry in America today.

Under Trump, 91 of our richest companies pay $0 in corporate taxes.

If they paid their 21% tax, we'd have the funds to end childhood hunger in America.

We must take on corporate power if we want a decent society for our children."
"Insurance companies made nearly $1 trillion in revenue last year while 87 million Americans went uninsured or underinsured.
 
The insurance industry maximizes profits by denying people care.
 
We need Medicare for All to make health care a universal human right in America."
"While Donald Trump says he wants ""the world's cleanest and safest air,"" he is fighting so that polluters can spew out more mercury and soot that will kill Americans.
 
Ordinary people are paying the price for Trump's lies."
"Ordinary workers pay into Social Security all year, but millionaires stop contributing today. That is absurd.

The ultra-wealthy should pay into Social Security at the same rate as everyone else, so that we expand‚Äînot cut‚Äîbenefits."
"It's no secret that the billionaire class dominates our political and economic life.

To end poverty, homelessness, hunger and lead poisoning in America, the ultra-rich must pay their fair share. Even if that means buying fewer $89 million paintings and $70 million cars."
"I congratulate the workers of Kickstarter, the first major tech company to vote for a union.
 
These workers are setting an example for the entire industry. Tech employees deserve job security, strong wages and benefits, and a voice in their companies."
"Today, Trump granted clemency to tax cheats, Wall Street crooks, billionaires, and corrupt government officials.

Meanwhile thousands of poor and working-class kids sit in jail for nonviolent drug convictions.

This is what a broken and racist criminal justice system looks like."
"Trump said he wanted to get America out of wars. He lied.

When we passed a bipartisan bill to end illegal support for Saudi airstrikes in Yemen, he vetoed it.

Trump ignored the Constitution to keep helping this brutal dictatorship as it bombs civilians."
"After taking government handouts like $880 million in tax breaks in 2018, Walmart is now cutting jobs.

Here's a ""radical"" idea: The richest corporations in America laying off workers and paying them starvation wages need to get off corporate welfare."
"U.S. bombings are at a record high in 18 years of fighting in Afghanistan. Our service members continue to fight and die in America's longest war.

The American people do not want endless war. We must bring our troops home."
"It was true in 1993 and it is true now: the time is long, long overdue for the United States to join the rest of the industrialized world and have a universal health care system."
"Fires threatening an entire continent are extreme‚Äîa Green New Deal to tackle the climate crisis is not.

Let us harness our skills, talents and enormous resources to protect the home we all share."

"AR-15s have one purpose: to kill and maim human beings.

Ban assault weapons."
"We live in a country which canprovide literally hundreds ofmillions of dollars to CEOs,and yet we have teachers whohave to take money out of theirown pockets to buy schoolsupplies.

If we believe in the futureof this country, we have got tobelieve in our educators."
"The world's richest 1% have over twice the wealth of 6.9 billion people.

The planet will not be secure or peaceful when so few have so much and so many have so little."
"Many of my colleagues believe we should throw more money into our bloated $740 billion military budget‚Äîmore than the next ten nations combined. 

I say, let us invest in our youth. 

Let us protect our seniors.

Let us repair our crumbling infrastructure."
"When General Electric outsources jobs, it raves about China.

When GE wants to pay $0 in taxes for eight straight years, or needs a $16 billion bailout, it doesn't talk about China.

GE goes to the taxpayers of the United States for its welfare checks."
Jane and I wish everyone a Happy Valentine's Day filled with love and compassion.
"Two years ago, 17 students and faculty of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School were brutally killed.

One year ago, the House passed HR 8 to require universal background checks for guns.

90% of Americans support this policy.

Senator McConnell: Do your damn job. Pass this bill."
"We don't talk enough about the positive impact of Social Security. Before it was law, half of seniors lived in poverty. It cuts the racial wealth gap and has lifted millions from poverty. 

Our job is not to cut Social Security. Our job is to expand it."
"Today the Senate voted, 55-45, to stop a war with Iran.

The Constitution made sure Congress could vote to block a president from taking our country into needless conflicts.

We cannot allow Trump to send working-class kids to fight and die in another endless war."
"I voted YES. Unlike Trump, today's bipartisan vote made it clear that a majority of the U.S. Senate believes in our Constitution and the separation of powers. It is Congress, not the president, who has the power to take this country into war, and that's what this vote was about."
"Our planet just experienced the hottest January in recorded history.
 
If our political system won't allow us move quickly to 100% renewable energy as the scientists say we must, I believe it is time for a political revolution."
"Today, I am voting for a bipartisan War Powers Resolution to stop Trump's dangerous escalation with Iran and uphold our Constitution.

Sadly, too many Republican Senators are willing to give this reckless president even more power to launch illegal war."

"My friend @MarkRuffalo is right. Fracking poisons our water and causes climate change.

I am proud to introduce the first nationwide fracking ban with @AOC, @SenJeffMerkley and @RepDarrenSoto.

Our job: End the greed of the fracking industry and rapidly move to renewable energy."
"The big banks don't want us to cancel all $1.7 trillion in student debt by taxing Wall Street speculation.

Too bad. It will be a tremendous act of economic, racial, and social justice for working people."
"I voted against the Patriot Act in 2001, 2006, 2011 and 2015. I strongly oppose its reauthorization next month.

I believe that in a democratic and constitutional form of government, we cannot sacrifice the civil liberties that make us a free country."
"Many public colleges and universities were tuition-free 50 years ago.

America is now twice as rich.

I think maybe we can afford to stop punishing our young people with student debt for the ""crime"" of getting an education.

It's time to make college a right for all."
"When I say Trump is a pathological liar, what do I mean? He promised to ""always protect"" Medicare and Social Security last week. Yesterday, he released a budget to:

If Big Pharma refuses, we end their patent monopolies and allow cheap generics to be made, saving Americans billions of dollars a year."
"Decades of corporate trade have devastated our manufacturing base, killing millions of blue-collar jobs.

A Green New Deal ends that. We will create millions of good, union jobs to manufacture renewable energy, increase energy efficiency, and rebuild our infrastructure."
"Jeff Bezos is the richest man in the world and Amazon is worth more than a trillion dollars.

Workers there should not be 3 times more likely to be injured on the job. Bathroom breaks should not be considered ""time off task."" Amazon's warehouse conditions are intolerable."
"People are being thrown in jail for being unable to pay their medical bills.

To my mind, that is outrageous and un-American.

""Medical debt"" should not exist."
"Trump said he would ‚Äúalways protect your Medicare and Social Security. Always.‚Äù Today, his budget is cutting them by hundreds of billions of dollars.

I will do everything in my power to ensure that Congress rejects this budget of, for, and by the 1%."
"Corporations have dumped toxic ""forever chemicals"" into our environment. It's now in 43 cities' water supplies.

My bill forces these companies to pay for the cleanup.

Maybe I'm ""radical,"" but I think the water in our taps must be free of toxic chemicals."
"I don't hear bankers complain about ""big government"" when taxpayers hand them a trillion-dollar bailout.

I don't see drug companies grumble when ""big government"" gives them patent monopolies to charge sky-high prices.

I don't know who's more corrupt: Wall Street or Big Pharma."
"Opioid makers flooded America with 100 billion pills from 2006-2014.

130,000 people died due to their greed.

Executives lied about opioids‚Äô addictiveness, pocketing billions in profits.

My Opioid Crisis Accountability and Results Act helps put corporate criminals behind bars."
"Trump could get us into never-ending, perpetual warfare in the Middle East. The Senate must pass my No War Against Iran Act."
"What kind of money would it take to end homelessness in America?

Making five companies‚ÄîAmazon, Delta, Starbucks, Chevron and General Motors‚Äîpay the corporate tax rate that's on the books instead of paying $0."
"I live 50 miles away from the Canadian border. You don't take out your wallet or your credit card when you go to the doctor or the hospital there.

If Canada can provide health care to all its people at half the cost, we can join the rest of the world and pass Medicare for All."
"Since my first day in Congress, I've been fighting to raise the minimum wage. Every worker in America should make at least $15 an hour."
"Why does America pay 1,000% more for the exact same prescription drugs as the rest of the world?

It might be for the same reason our top pharmaceutical CEOs make $50 million a year."
"A huge number of complicated insurance plans force people to fill out endless forms and paperwork just to get the care they need.

Medicare for All eliminates wasteful bureaucracy and red tape, saving doctors and patients both time and money."
Our corrupt campaign finance system is increasingly controlled by billionaires and special interests. We must fight this drift toward oligarchy. The future of our democracy is at stake.
"The majority of low-wage workers in America today are women and people of color.

When we fight to double the minimum wage to a $15 living wage, we are fighting to advance racial, gender, and economic justice."
"Big banks borrow money from the Federal Reserve at 2.25%.

Then they can charge you a 30% interest rate on your credit card.

Today, loan sharks wear fancy suits and work on Wall Street.

There must be a limit on their greed. My bill with @AOC caps all credit card rates at 15%."
"In an act of moral cowardice, Congress handed Trump $738 billion for a Pentagon budget that arms submarines with ""low-yield"" nuclear weapons.

Our military contractor friends are excited about this‚Äîthey will make zillions of dollars‚Äîbut I am not so sure working people are."
"Spring weather in Antarctica is truly insane.

Climate change is an existential threat to humanity. We must mobilize America and the rest of the world accordingly."
"Donald Trump said, ‚ÄúMy tax breaks will benefit working families‚Äînot the richest!‚Äù

But 83% of his tax cuts will go to the top 1% after 10 years.

It helped create the absurdity of Amazon not paying a nickel in federal taxes on $11 billion of profit.
 
Trump is a liar and a fraud."
"Let's be clear: Like every worker in America, nonprofit employees have a fundamental right to a union, good wages, benefits, paid time off, and a safe workplace."
"This is something I passionately believe in: health care must be a human right for every man, woman and child in America."
"Tonight the House acted to:

‚úì Protect workers from being illegally fired for union activities
‚úì Strengthen collective bargaining
‚úì Undo ‚ÄúRight to Work for Less"" laws
‚úì Defend the right to strike

This is an important step to leveling the playing field for working people."
"Congress presented Trump with our bipartisan bill to end the illegal U.S.-Saudi war in Yemen.

He vetoed it.
 
Violence has gotten worse, hundreds of thousands are dead, and Trump coddles the brutal Saudi dictatorship.

It's time to end this damn war."
"Our fight to end the fossil fuel industry‚Äôs destruction of our planet is not going away anytime soon.

Even the geniuses on Wall Street are starting to figure that out."
"Macy's made $1 billion in profits last year.

Its CEO makes 580 times more than the median worker.

Macy's paid $0 in taxes in 2017.

Now it's laying off 2,000 hard-working employees to make more profits.

Corporate America's greed has got to end."
"My voting record:

1993 NAFTA‚ÄîNO
2000 Permanent Normal Trade with China‚ÄîNO
2005 DR-CAFTA‚ÄîNO
2011 US-Colombia Trade Agreement‚ÄîNO
2015 Trans-Pacific Partnership‚ÄîNO
2020 USMCA‚ÄîNO

Corporate trade killed millions of American jobs. Workers must craft our trade deals‚Äînot big business."
"A president who is allowed to show contempt for Congress and its oversight duties.

A trial without a single witness.

I am disturbed by the precedent this sham process sets for this country.

This is not a good day for our democracy, the Constitution, or the American people."
"Today, I voted to convict President Trump on two articles of impeachment. It gives me no pleasure to conclude that he is guilty of the offenses laid out in the trial.

Sadly, we have a president who sees himself as above the law and is ignorant or indifferent to the Constitution."
"Maybe‚Äîjust maybe‚Äîinstead of spending $1.8 trillion a year on military budgets and weapons of destruction designed to kill each other, we can pool our resources as a planet to fight our common enemy: climate change."
Student lunch debt should not exist. My bill with Rep. @Ilhan abolishes all of it.
"More than 1.5 million children went homeless during the school year.

Three people now own more wealth than half of America combined.

Is this the kind of society and economy we want to live in?"
"The clean energy revolution cannot be stopped by politicians in the pocket of the fossil fuel industry. In 10 years:
 
üí®üìâWind energy prices fell 70%
‚òÄÔ∏èüìâSolar prices fell 90%
 
We will create millions of jobs and save Americans money as we move to a renewable energy economy."
"If the minimum wage had kept up with productivity growth since 1968, every worker would make at least $24 an hour.

Instead, half our workers earn less than $19 an hour today.

We need a strong trade union movement to reverse corporate America's 50-year war on the working class."
"We are not going to waste another 40 years testing trickle-down economics, which have devastated America's working class.

The time is long overdue for the rich to start paying their damn taxes."
"Hours of paperwork. Insurance costs that dwarf their own salaries. Small business owners dealing with our dysfunctional system know that the solution is a Medicare for All, single-payer national health program."
"Returning asylum-seekers to Mexico where there is no oversight or accommodation is wrong.

If we turn our backs on refugees, we will be destroying what this country is supposed to be about."
"What do Amazon, Starbucks, Chevron, Netflix, GM, Duke Energy, Xcel Energy, Halliburton, Eli Lilly, JetBlue, U.S. Steel, FedEx, and Dow-DuPont have in common?
 
They all paid $0 in corporate taxes last year.

We need government of, by, and for the people‚Äînot huge corporations."
"Of all the corrupt institutions in America, I haven‚Äôt figured out who's worse: Wall Street or the drug companies.

We must build a movement strong enough to put an end to their greed and control over our government."
"A Green New Deal to defeat humanity's common enemy, climate change, is far cheaper than the cost of doing nothing."
"Our job is not only to provide every American with health care, but substantially expand Medicare benefits. Medicare for All will:

üë©üèΩ‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è Cover vision, hearing, and dental care for all
üíä Cap everyone's out-of-pocket drug costs at $200 a year
üè† Support long-term care at home"
"Tonight, more than 500,000 Americans will sleep in the streets.

This year, 80% of all new rentals will be luxury apartments.
 
That is immoral. We will make the top 1% pay their fair share of taxes and make housing a human right. The ultra-rich can no longer have it all."
"If Wall Street bankers are annoyed with their ""underwhelming"" bonuses right now, just wait until we pass my Tax Excessive CEO Pay Act."
"Last week, the House passed the No War Against Iran Act that I introduced with @RepRoKhanna.

Senate Republicans now have a choice: Will they pass my bill and stand up for the Constitution? Or will they allow Trump to illegally lead us into a disastrous war in the Middle East?"
"We must finally put an end to the disastrous, so-called ""War on Drugs.""

This includes legalizing marijuana, releasing those imprisoned because of it, expunging their records, and investing in the communities devastated by this decades-long assault."
"Bad news for those who say our seniors' benefits are too ""extravagant"": We're expanding them.

My Social Security Expansion Act provides low-income seniors $1,300 more a year by making millionaires and billionaires pay their share of Social Security taxes."
"Just how rich are Wall Street speculators?

A tax of just a few pennies on their financial trading can fund tuition-free public college for all and erase all $1,700,239,090,564 in student debt.

This is how we make higher education a right in America."
"‚¨ÜÔ∏èIn 1965, public college tuition was $2,000 a year. Now it‚Äôs $10,000.

‚¨áÔ∏èIn 1968 the minimum wage was $10. Now it‚Äôs $7.25.

If we're not supposed to learn from other wealthy countries, we can sure as hell look at policies America had 50 years ago, when we were half as rich."
"The financial sector grew fivefold as a share of the economy since the 1970s. 

The result? More greed, corruption, criminality, bloated CEO pay, financial crashes and taxpayer bailouts.

Maybe Wall Street should face some downsizing so that the working class can finally thrive."
"For the price of this single $13 billion warship‚Äîa total boondoggle‚Äîwe could provide America's children universal school lunches for a full year.

This is why we must confront the military-industrial complex and end the profiteering off of weapons of war."
"It‚Äôs time for us to join the rest of the world's rich countries and guarantee:

üë∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Living wages
üí™üèæ Strong unions
üè• Universal health care
üèñ Paid vacation and family leave
üë©üèΩ‚Äçüéì Tuition-free college
üßìüèª Retirement security

Americans deserve to live with dignity too."
"A majority of our seniors get most of their income from Social Security‚Äîless than $1,500 a month, on average.

Washington lobbyists can spend that in one night on a fancy dinner!

Tell me why we can give billionaires tax breaks but can't afford to expand Social Security."
"In my humble opinion, a great nation is not judged by the number of billionaires or nuclear weapons it has.

It is judged by how it treats the weakest and most vulnerable people amongst us."
"Why are Wall Street investors getting scared of fossil fuel stocks?
 
Because the climate justice movement is making it clear that political pressure for divestment will not stop. It will only grow stronger.
 
To protect our planet, we are taking on Big Oil‚Äîand we're winning."
"By a vote of 51 to 49, the Senate refused to subpoena witnesses in this impeachment trial.

I've never heard of a trial where you don't have witnesses.

This is a sad day in American history."
"A fair impeachment trial means hearing testimony from witnesses. 

This is not a radical idea.
 
So what are Republicans afraid of?"
"The richest 400 billionaires pay lower taxes than fast-food workers. 

If we are to stop the war being waged by the billionaire class against working Americans, we need a tax on extreme wealth."
"CEOs at Merck and Pfizer each make almost $50 million a year. A senior's median income is $25,000 a year.

Pharma CEOs get rich charging the world‚Äôs highest prices. Seniors cut their pills in half and skip groceries trying to afford them.

That is disgusting and has got to end."
"I applaud the House of Representatives for passing the Stop War Against Iran Act that I introduced with @RepRoKhanna, and @RepBarbaraLee's repeal of the 2002 Authorization for Use of Military Force.

The Senate must now take up these vital bills to stop endless war."
"Instead of fixing our broken health care system, Trump continues to waste time and endanger lives trying to kick people off Medicaid. 

He should listen to the 90 percent of Americans who think Medicaid is important and expand the program, not cut it."
"I don't mind if @MarkRuffalo spoils his own movies. But please, don't ruin the surprise of our new legislation with Rep. @AOC, @SenJeffMerkley and @RepDarrenSoto.

I don't want the dirty fracking industry CEOs to know what hit them."
"This is what oligarchy looks like: large corporations get trillions in tax cuts and subsidies, while nannies, home care workers and housekeepers are denied basic labor protections against underpayment and harassment.

Congress must pass a #DomesticWorkerBillofRights."
"Time and time again, large technology corporations are trampling on the rights of consumers with impunity. The job of the Federal Trade Commission is to regulate industry and defend the public interest. The FTC must get its act together."
"Tonight I asked my question in Trump's impeachment trial:

President Trump claims there was no quid pro quo in holding back military aid to Ukraine. He has lied more than 16,000 times in office. Why should we believe him?"
"It is not a radical idea that when Americans turn on their taps, the drinking water should be clean.

At 6:30 p.m. EST, tune in for a livestream of my discussion with @RepDebDingell and actor @MarkRuffalo regarding the cleanup of toxic PFAS chemicals."
"I proudly oppose Trump's NAFTA 2.0. The United States outsourced more than 170,000 jobs in the last three years. The deal doesn't even mention the words ""climate change.""

Our trade agreements must stop outsourcing and address the climate crisis threatening our planet."
We are practically the only major nation that doesn't offer paid family leave so that parents can be with their baby. That to me is unconscionable.
"We live in the richest country on earth.

School lunch debt should not exist.
Student loan debt should not exist.
Medical debt should not exist."
Senator McConnell: Hold a full and fair trial with witnesses.
"The United States can bring unequaled leadership to resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, but we must use that leadership to promote a just and durable agreement. Any acceptable peace deal must be consistent with international law and multiple UN resolutions."
"""The medication I am taking costs $1000 a month.

"Today‚Äôs young people face the prospect of:

üî•A planet on fire
üìâLower living standards than their parents
üí≥Crushing debt and inequality
üí•Endless war

At this fateful moment, we can change the course of history‚Äîif enough ordinary people get engaged in the political process."
"This country was built by immigrants. The American people want comprehensive, humane immigration reform.

We must reverse these Trump programs which are designed to demonize and hurt those who are the most vulnerable of all."
"I stand with these Amazon employees who are courageously speaking out. They are telling Jeff Bezos to end his hypocrisy: You cannot call your corporation a ""leader"" on climate change while partnering with ExxonMobil and BP to extract more fossil fuels."
"Credit card interest rates are absurdly high‚Äîthe median credit card interest rate is an outrageous 21 percent.

Working together, we will end the greed of Wall Street banks ripping off the American people. My legislation with @AOC puts a common-sense cap on interest rates."
"John Bolton claims Trump told him he would withhold military aid from Ukraine until the country helped him investigate Democrats.

The Senate must hear from Bolton as a witness in the impeachment proceedings."
"The American people are sick and tired of endless war.

We must invest in human needs‚Äînot waste trillions of dollars on death and destruction."
"Our current system:

üí∞Creates $100 billion in health industry profits
‚ö†Ô∏èKeeps 87 million people uninsured or underinsured
üí≥Bankrupts 500,000 people
üíäMakes drugs unaffordable
üìàCosts 2x per person with worse health outcomes than other rich countries

We need Medicare for All."
"I said it in 1992 and not much seems to have changed. By and large, the Congress is owned by big money interests and the largest corporations in America."
Solitary confinement is a form of torture. It is unconstitutional. It has got to be abolished as part of comprehensive reform to our racist criminal justice system.
"Four-year public university tuition in 1965 cost $1,926 a year. Today, it is $9,037 a year.

Taxpayers paid for a trillion-dollar bailout to benefit the crooks on Wall Street.

I think we can afford to make public colleges tuition-free and cancel all student debt."
"This is what Donald Trump means when he says he wants ""crystal clean water."" Disgusting."
"To all those celebrating, happy #LunarNewYear! Wishing good health, prosperity, and joy to you and your loved ones in the new year."
"My dad came from a very poor, rural area in Poland. He raised a family and became a very proud American.

When Trump demonizes minorities and immigrants, he wants to divide us up.

We must build a political movement to create a different kind of America‚Äîwith values that unite us."
Because of the lies and greed of Big Oil.
"The four largest banks in America‚ÄîBank of America, Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase, and Wells Fargo‚Äîare on average 80 percent larger than they were before they were bailed out by American taxpayers.

Our job is to break them up."
"This man's doctor told him to delay treatment because of insanely high costs.

Now he recognizes what 70% of Americans already understand: We need to join the rest of the developed world. We need Medicare for All."
"As a candidate, Trump said he'd protect Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid.

Now he has an obligation to tell the American people: ""I was lying. It was all just a campaign ruse."""
"I stand with the people of Puerto Rico demanding accountability and an end to corruption. After a decade of austerity, hurricanes and earthquakes, Puerto Ricans have a right to a responsive government and full federal support to put an end to this crisis."
"The richest 1% is full of tax cheats. They are responsible for 70% of all unpaid taxes in America. 

If they just paid what they owe, we could build 26 million affordable homes‚Äîmore than enough for every family paying half their income or more on housing."
"Mnuchin's economics experience? Being called the ""Foreclosure King"" for heading a bank that kicked 50,000 families out of their homes.

Keep going, Greta. Scientists tell us we must transform our economy to save the planet. Economists say we'll create millions of jobs doing so."
"Climate change is more likely to impact poor people and people of color first and worst. Yet the world's poorest people are least responsible for the changing climate.

We must transition our economy away from fossil fuels to fight growing inequality here and around the world."
"Nearly half a century ago, the Supreme Court affirmed abortion as a constitutional right.

I am sick and tired of conservatives who say, ""Get government off our backs,"" while telling women what they can do with their bodies.

Women get to control their bodies‚Äînot politicians."
"I congratulate Spain's government for declaring a climate emergency. The United States must now follow suit. 

My resolution with @AOC and @RepBlumenauer mobilizes America to defeat the existential threat facing humanity."
Strong unions are key to solving the crises facing higher education. I am delighted to join @repmarkpocan in this effort to protect graduate student workers who are organizing for their rights.
"58 new abortion restrictions were enacted across the country in 2019.

Laws like these are dangerous, regressive, and blatantly unconstitutional.

On the 47th anniversary of Roe v. Wade, we must continue to stand up for women‚Äôs reproductive freedom and protect access to abortion."
"The free press is never more important than when it exposes wrongdoing by the powerful.
 
That is why President Bolsonaro is threatening Glenn Greenwald for the ""crime"" of doing journalism.
 
I call on Brazil to end its authoritarian attack on press freedom and the rule of law."
"Senate Republicans, working directly with the White House, voted to prevent witnesses from testifying in Trump‚Äôs impeachment trial.
 
What are Republicans afraid of? Today was a bad day for our country, for our Constitution, and for the rule of law."
"Today is a sad day in history: the beginning of an impeachment trial for the President.

It would be absurd to have a trial at 1 o'clock in the morning without any witnesses.

I say to Senator McConnell: hold a fair trial with witnesses, in full view of the American people."
"What Dr. King understood is that the only way you make real change‚Äîwhether it is racial justice, social justice or economic justice‚Äîis when millions of people come together, stand up and fight back. #MLKDay"
"In 1968, Dr. King said ‚ÄúNow our struggle is for genuine equality, which means economic equality.‚Äù

The minimum wage then was worth $10.15. Today, it‚Äôs $7.25.

Our fight for human dignity must include making every job pay a living wage of at least $15 an hour. #MLKDay"
"To truly honor Dr. King we must fight to carry out his radical and bold vision for racial and economic justice in America and transform our national priorities. The struggle continues to this day, and our work is far from over. #MLKDay"

We can and must achieve Medicare for All in the United States."
"How can it be that millions of people live in poverty while working full time in the world‚Äôs richest country for the world‚Äôs richest companies? How can we tolerate this? 

The answer is clear: pay every worker at least $15 an hour and let them unionize."
Marijuana must be legalized. All our people imprisoned because of it must be returned home to their families and their records expunged.
"I‚Äôm proud of my state, Vermont, for leading the nation in considering making free school meals universal for children.

In the richest country in the history of the world, ‚Äúlunch debt‚Äù for hungry kids trying to learn at school should not exist."
"Unreliable electricity and water, untreated wounds, vermin. These prison conditions are intolerable.

We lock up more people‚Äîdisproportionately Black and brown‚Äîthan any other country on Earth.

We need comprehensive prison reform as a matter of racial and social justice."
"Don't you feel grateful? The world‚Äôs most expensive drug is coming out‚Äî$2-3 million a pop.

$69 billion in annual profits were just not enough for Big Pharma.

BioMarin should lose its patent monopoly for this price-gouging. Under our legislation, it will."
"250 pages.

37,500 words.

Not a single damn mention of ‚Äúclimate change.‚Äù

Trump‚Äôs NAFTA is a giveaway to the fossil fuel industry.

I voted NO because the future of our planet is more important than the short-term profits of Exxon Mobil and Chevron."
"Why will our agenda‚Äîliving wages, a healthy planet, peace, health care, education and housing for all‚Äîsucceed?

Because that is the agenda of the working class. The majority.

And when working people come together and fight for it, big-money interests don‚Äôt stand a chance."
"My friend Senator Schumer is right. Trump's NAFTA does not even mention the words ""climate change""‚Äîthe existential threat facing not only our country but the entire planet."
Cancel it. Every penny.
"It‚Äôs time we make the richest 1% pay their damn taxes and make safe, affordable housing a human right."
"I stand proudly with labor unions, environmental organizations and family farmers against Trump‚Äôs NAFTA 2.0.

In my view, we must rewrite our disastrous trade agreements to end the outsourcing of American jobs, combat climate change, and stop the destructive race to the bottom."
"Congratulations to advocates in Richmond who won this ballot measure to restrict coal exports. I stand with the communities who are fighting fossil fuel CEOs every step of the way.

Our job: Break our addiction to fossil fuels and create millions of family-sustaining clean jobs."
Trump‚Äôs deal with China won't fix a failed trade policy that has destroyed 3.7 million U.S. jobs. I am proud to have voted against the disastrous 2000 China trade agreement. We need a trade policy that stops giant corporations from shipping jobs overseas and polluting our planet.
"It is outrageous that the President‚Äôs personal lawyers appear to have directed the surveillance of a U.S. ambassador.

This must be fully investigated as the Senate conducts the impeachment trial. We have a responsibility to hold this lawless administration to account."
"Weeks have passed since the House passed legislation to lower prescription drug prices, but Mr. Trump has already promised to veto it.
 
He never had the guts to stand up to his billionaire friends and Big Pharma, whose greed is killing Americans."
"At a time when there are so many vulnerable seniors out there whose entire income is Social Security, we cannot tolerate any cuts.

No senior should live in poverty. We must expand Social Security so every American can retire with the dignity and the respect they deserve."
"No successful effort to end war happened without massive grassroots pressure. If enough ordinary people get engaged in the political process, we can change the course of history."
"BlackRock, the largest Wall Street investment firm in the world, says today that it will focus on environmental sustainability.

It can start by ending its investments in destroying the Amazon rainforest. Funding the slashing and burning of our planet's lungs is a disgrace."
"I cannot, for the life of me, begin to understand the cruelty of a president who‚Äîjust two years after passing a $1.5 trillion tax giveaway to the rich‚Äîis now cutting food assistance to 700,000 hungry people.

We have all the resources we need to eradicate hunger in America."
"As I said at the time, it was shameful to give Trump a huge Pentagon budget without putting real limits on his abuse of power.
 
Now he's unconstitutionally diverting $7 billion to build his border wall.

When will Congress finally have the guts to rein in this lawless president?"
"Don't tell me the United States cannot implement a Medicare for All system to guarantee health care to every man, woman and child.

If every other major country can do it, then surely so can we."
"Both @RepRoKhanna and I got involved in politics as young people because of our shared opposition to unjust war.

We cannot let this generation experience horrors akin to Vietnam or Iraq. This is how we stop a war with Iran:"
"The people of Puerto Rico have been battered by hurricanes and earthquakes. They need humanitarian assistance now.

We will end the 40-year assault on the working class and the suffering it has caused for our people.

Every job in America must pay a living wage of at least $15 an hour."
"We must stand shoulder to shoulder with the Muslim community. Trump's travel ban has never been about keeping America safe‚Äîjust look at the president's own word. It has always been a racist attempt to ban Muslims from entering the United States, which cannot be allowed to stand."
"Our bipartisan effort to end unauthorized military actions in Yemen passed the House and Senate. Trump vetoed it.
 
The result? He‚Äôs carrying out illegal assassination attempts in Yemen. Congress has got to stand up to this lawless president."
"Over the past 50 years:

‚¨ÜÔ∏è Real wages for the top 1% tripled
üîù The top 0.1% saw wages grow 450%
üìâ Pay for minimum-wage workers fell by 30%

The solution is clear: End the obscene profiteering, and make all jobs pay a living wage of at least $15."
"My colleagues and I are tired of endless wars. That is why we introduced the No War Against Iran Act. We must learn from our mistakes, not repeat them."
"The president is lying. He rolled back the Clean Power Plan, which will cause more deaths from air pollution.

He allowed more coal ash to contaminate our water with mercury and arsenic.

We must defeat his agenda to protect our health and environment."
"About 900,000 people in Puerto Rico are still without power. It is well past time to build a 100% sustainable, decentralized, resilient power grid in Puerto Rico‚Äîinstead of depending on outdated fossil fuel power plants that repeatedly plunge Puerto Rico into darkness."
"It is unbelievable that in the richest country on earth, community groups collect donations to pay off the lunch debt of elementary school kids.

Here's a radical idea: every child in America has the right to eat free nutritious meals at school every day."
"I am proud to stand with my colleagues today to reassert our constitutional authority and introduce legislation‚Äîthe No War Against Iran Act‚Äîto stop President Trump from leading this country into an illegal war against Iran.

The American people are sick and tired of endless wars."
"American families are paying an $8,000 tax because of the greed of the health care industry. Don't take it from me. Take it from these economists.

Medicare for All means huge savings for working people and guaranteed health care for all."
"The American people do not want war with Iran. They want to invest in health care, education, housing, and good jobs.
 
Congress cannot stand by. It must act now to pass our legislation to uphold the Constitution and prevent Trump from spending trillions more on endless war."
"Trump said he wouldn‚Äôt cut Social Security. He lied. He is working to stop Americans from getting the benefits they paid for and need.

No, Mr. President: We will not let you cut Social Security. We will fight to expand it."
"The Trump administration doesn't have a clue about what it is doing, but is creating a very dangerous world scenario. Let us never forget that the Constitution, which some of us actually believe and respect, says Congress has the responsibility for making war, not the President."
"States and cities handed out free cash to huge corporations but saw no new economic growth.

Trickle-down economics was a success. Congratulations to the millionaires and billionaires who made out like bandits. You guys won."
"Cost of having a baby with health insurance today: $4,500
Cost of having a baby under Medicare for All: $0

We can afford Medicare for All. What we can't afford is continuing to charging families in the U.S. more than any other country for giving birth."
"The Trump administration has failed the people of Puerto Rico. The island is still rebuilding from Hurricane Maria, which struck the island two years ago. Now Puerto Rico is suffering blackouts after a devastating earthquake. We must do everything we can to help rebuild."
The greed of corporate executives and the billionaire class is destroying this country and whether they like it or not we are going to stop that greed.
"To my mind, the mistake was invading Iraq."
"Amazon's workers are speaking out to say: Jeff Bezos should not be in the business of fossil fuel extraction.

The company‚Äôs response? Retaliate with threats of firing.

I stand with these employees who are fighting to protect the only home we have."
"Here is my question for Trump: what are you afraid of?

If you are not guilty of abuse of power, you should welcome testimony from your former national security advisor and other witnesses.

If you did nothing wrong, then join me in calling for a full and fair impeachment trial."
"We face urgent needs to rebuild our infrastructure, build affordable housing, and address the existential crisis of climate change. 

Congress must stand up and say no: We are not giving you a nickel to wage unauthorized war on Iran. We as a nation must get our priorities right."
Child care should not cost parents more than sending their kids to college. We need a revolution in child care in this country.
Congress must reassert its constitutional responsibility over war. The Senate and House must vote to immediately defund unauthorized military action against Iran.
"As GDP grew over the past ten years, the minimum wage declined in real dollars, from $8.70 to $7.25.

This is a disgrace. Working people were cheated out of billions.

We must double the minimum wage to $15 an hour and give 40 million workers a raise‚Äîas a matter of justice."
"Not on our watch. Abortion is a constitutional right‚Äîperiod. To the hypocritical Republicans who claim to love ""small government"": No, we will not let you take away women's constitutional right to control their own bodies."
"I am introducing a bill with Rep. Khanna to stop Donald Trump from illegally taking us to war against Iran.

It's working-class kids who will have to fight and die in a disastrous new Middle East conflict‚Äînot the children of billionaires."
"Pharmaceutical corporate greed is literally killing people who cannot afford their medication. Together, we can change that."
"The president can boast about the stock market all he wants‚Äîthe American people know it doesn't put food on the table. We need an economy that works for the many, not just the wealthy and large corporations."

I was right about Iraq.

I will do everything in my power to prevent a war with Iran.

I apologize to no one."

67% want a $15 minimum wage
88% want universal background checks on guns
77% say it‚Äôs unfair to pay women less than men

Let the Senate vote on bills supported by the vast majority of America."
"The disastrous Citizens United decision lets corporate America spend unlimited sums of money buying the airwaves for elections. It is totally legal, but not what America should be about.
 
Millions of ordinary Americans must push back if we want real democracy in this country."
"I say to those who are delaying action on climate change: Look at the blood-red sky and unbreathable air in Australia because of raging forest fires. 
 
Our futures are all connected. That is why we must bring the world together and enact a Green New Deal."
Congratulations to the 47 states and localities that are raising the minimum wage today‚Äîthe largest number of jurisdictions in history.

Now it's time to make this a reality everywhere in America."
"Trump said he‚Äôd get us ‚Äúcrystal clean water‚Äù and the ‚Äúpurest air on the planet.‚Äù

His EPA is working to let polluters dump more mercury, pesticides, and fossil fuel emissions into our environment. Our people will get sicker.

We must defeat the agenda of this pathological liar."
"Patriotic millionaires like Abigail Disney are right. By any objective measure, a CEO-to-worker pay ratio over a thousand is insane."
"If we were a poor country, we could sit around and say it's too bad we can't have good health care for all people. 

Well, guess what. The United States is the wealthiest country in the history of the world."
"One out of every five children in America lives in poverty.

This year alone, the richest 172 billionaires in America added half a trillion dollars to their fortunes.

Billionaires stepping over children sleeping on the street is not what this country is supposed to be about."
We need to revitalize American democracy if we are to have government policy that does not allow the fossil fuel industry‚Äôs profiteering to destroy our planet.
"On this final evening of Hanukkah, a celebration of light overcoming darkness, Jane and I send our love and support to our Jewish brothers and sisters during this difficult time.
 
Let us all recommit to standing together to defeat bigotry, violence, and anti-Semitism."
"If working people‚Äîthe vast majority of our country‚Äîdon't have income to spend on goods and services, we can't create jobs. 

There is a limit to how many limousines and yachts you can have. When so few have so much, it is not only a moral issue, it is also an economic issue."
"How does it happen that the pharmaceutical companies can charge any price they want for prescription drugs? 

The answer is clear: The prescription drug industry is one of the most powerful political forces in America."
"Ultimately, we face a choice: do we tolerate the insatiable greed of the billionaire class, whose control over our political system lets them take food out of the mouths of hungry school kids? 

Or do we build an equitable society that ends poverty, hunger and homelessness?"
What motivates some of these people is greed and greed and more greed. It is like a sickness. It is like an addiction.
"Storytellers are vital to our movement. @MarkRuffalo is lifting up the story of the ordinary heroes who stood up to the deadly lies and greed of DuPont.

Corporations are used to buying off our political system. When millions of people come together, we are going to change that."
"Over 40 years, the richest 0.1% have seen their wages quadruple, leaving everyone‚Äîeven the top 1%‚Äîbehind.

Here's how we reverse this trend:
‚úÖEnsure every job pays at least a living wage
‚úÖRapidly expand unions
‚úÖMake the ultra-rich pay their taxes
‚úÖEnd corporate welfare"
"How can the Sackler family be proud to say they are multibillionaires while so many children cope with the horrific trauma of having their parents die from opioid addiction?

This greed‚Äîthis reckless, uncontrollable greed‚Äîis devastating our country."
"An MRI scan costs $1,420 in America. It runs $450 in the UK.

A U.S. angioplasty costs $32,200. In the Netherlands, it's $6,400.

Other major countries cover all their people and pay half of what we do. Don't tell me we can't afford Medicare for All."
"A political revolution is underway. 

On January 1, thanks to millions of working people engaging at all levels of government, 21 states and 26 localities will raise the minimum wage.

This is the largest number of states, cities and counties raising the wage in American history."
Donald Trump's ignorance on the climate change emergency is threatening the very lives of our children and future generations.
"No one inside the Beltway seems to ask how much the status quo costs. I'll tell you. Each year:

‚Ä¢ 100,000 Americans die from air pollution
‚Ä¢ Thousands die for lack of health insurance
 
We have the resources‚Äîand a moral obligation‚Äîto pass Medicare for All and a Green New Deal."
"Jane and I wish everyone a merry Christmas and a happy holiday. As we head into a new year, let us rededicate ourselves to a world of peace and justice."
"Trump is kicking 700,000 hungry people off nutrition assistance. But the holiday spirit is alive and well when it comes to taxpayer giveaways to billionaires.

There's a name for this kind of system: oligarchy. @RepRashida and I believe we must fight back."
"The CIA concluded that the Saudi crown prince ordered the murder of Jamal Khashoggi. This sham trial, carried out by a despotic and lawless regime, looks more like a cover-up. 

Maybe Donald Trump might want to stop proclaiming his love and affection for the Saudi dictatorship."
"Amazon, Delta, Starbucks, Chevron and General Motors each paid $0 in federal taxes.
 
If these five companies paid their 21% corporate tax rate, we'd have enough revenue to end homelessness in America and stop the horror of people dying in the cold."
Trickle-down economics has always been a fraud. It is an idea propagated by big-money interests to give an intellectual veneer for more tax breaks for billionaires.
"Instead of listening to Sheldon Adelson and other multibillionaire campaign contributors, it is time to start listening to the overwhelming majority of Americans who want a government and an economy that works for the many‚Äînot just the few."
"In 1970, 30-year-olds had a 92% chance of earning more than their parents did at the same age.

By 2010, income per person doubled. But 30-year-olds only had a 50% shot at doing better than their parents.

We cannot afford more decades of decline. We must transform our economy."
It is an absolute disgrace that a refugee agency protecting migrant children could be turned into part of Trump's deportation machine. This is not what America is about.
"The holiday shopping season is the most dangerous time of the year for Amazon warehouse workers. They suffer twice the injuries as the rest of the industry.

@Ilhan and I demand that the Department of Labor stop this abuse."
Shutting out U.S. lawmakers who are standing up for human rights is what we expect from authoritarian regimes‚Äînot the government of India. @RepJayapal is right. She must not be excluded for being outspoken about the unacceptable crackdown on Kashmiris and Muslims.
Congress does not regulate Wall Street‚ÄîWall Street regulates Congress. Break them up.
"The industries making obscene profits off of health care have armies of Washington lobbyists willing to block any progress‚Äîno matter how small.

Our job is to build a movement strong enough to defeat their greed and deliver Medicare for All to the people."
"We are dealing with an eviction crisis in America. Millions of families, even working full time, can't make rent.

Living wages and dignified housing are universal human rights. In the world's richest country, we ought to start treating them that way."
"If 147 of America's richest companies had paid their 21% corporate tax rate instead of dodging taxes in 2018, we'd raise enough new revenue to eliminate homelessness and child hunger.

Now you know why corporate America calls our agenda preposterous, unrealistic and unserious."
"Two-thirds of America thinks the economy is helping the rich and hurting the working class.

What particularly angers me‚Äîand why people have such contempt for Washington‚Äîis the corporate control over our political life while the middle class disappears."
"The House of Representatives rightly carried out its constitutional responsibility by voting to impeach Donald Trump, the most corrupt president in our history. No one, including the president, is above the law."
"Anybody with any sense can understand the point of Trump's tax scam. As more and more wealth and power concentrates with the rich and the large corporations, less and less power rests with the average American worker."
"Young people did what they were told‚Äîthey got an education and worked hard. Their reward? Millennials could face worse living standards than their parents.

I asked for a government study on this crisis. This new research confirms my fears:"
"The United States Congress just passed a $738 billion giveaway for arms manufacturers, Pentagon lobbyists, and unconstitutional wars. 

@RepRoKhanna is right‚Äîthis is not what resistance to Donald Trump looks like."
"We are producing enough to feed the hungry, to clothe the naked, to shelter the homeless, and provide what people need.

And yet we have an economy which works day after day to make billionaires richer and turns its back on desperate people."
"Corporations tell workers that forming a union will hurt business. Yet somehow they can still afford hundreds of millions of dollars on expensive union-busting firms.
 
We are going to end the corporate assault on workers standing up for their rights."
"The richest Americans who are doing phenomenally well? Rewarded with tax breaks.

The largest corporations enjoying record-breaking profits? Tax breaks.

Americans in need of help? The Trump administration will cut nutrition support to 700,000 of them."
Failure is not an option. We are running out of time. The United States must lead the world in reducing carbon emissions and bring countries together to secure global action to avert climate catastrophe.
"Equal pay for equal work: women want that whole damn dollar, not 79 cents on the dollar."
"Right now, millionaires and billionaires pay the same amount of money into Social Security as someone making $133,000.

Why does the burden of Social Security taxes fall more heavily on those who make less? That is wrong and it has got to change."
"Disney CEO Bob Iger's pay: $65.6 million
Disney workers: Living out of their cars

When we consider this grotesque inequality in wealth and power, ultimately we are asking a moral question: What kind of nation will we be?"
"We could eradicate HIV/AIDS in America. What‚Äôs standing in the way? The greed of the pharmaceutical industry.

An $8 HIV drug in Australia costs $2,000 in America. That is immoral. We need affordable, generic HIV medicine. Now."
"On the anniversary of the horrific Sandy Hook shootings, we must recommit to doing everything we can to stop gun violence.

The House passed gun-safety legislation almost 300 days ago. Senator McConnell's obstruction is unacceptable. Now is the time to save lives in this country."
"Our obstacle to solving the climate crisis is not technological‚Äîit is political. We have what we need to rapidly move to a 100% renewable-energy economy. 

Now we must build a powerful political movement to make that happen."
Fraud is the business model of the military-industrial complex. The time is long overdue for us to stand up to their lobbyists and fight for the basic needs of working families throughout this country.
"The United States must rise to the moral challenge of our time: climate change. We can bring countries together, harness America's know-how to transition the world to sustainable energy, and protect our planet. That is what real global leadership is about."
"Like the swindler he is, the president used charity money for veterans to pay off his own debts. The American people recognize he is the most corrupt president in modern history. Now even Mr. Trump has admitted his corruption."
"My friend @RepRoKhanna is right: it is Orwellian for Congress to hand over billions of dollars worth of weapons and bombs to a president waging a horrific, unconstitutional war in Yemen‚Äîand call that progressive."
"Mr. Trump and the GOP passed a tax scam two years ago. They said it would create jobs and boost wages.

Big surprise: none of that happened‚Äîbut who got richer? Their millionaire and billionaire donors."
Betsy DeVos will go down in history as the worst Education Secretary to ever hold that office.
"Over 50 years, the bottom half's annual income only grew by $8,000. Today, 50% of America makes $27,000 a year.
 
üìàBut the top 1%'s income tripled, to $1,000,000 a year.
üìàTop 0.1% grew 400%‚Äîto $5,000,000.
üìàTop 0.01% grew 500%‚Äîto $24,000,000.
 
We need a political revolution."
It is too late for us to carry on with establishment politics and establishment economics. This is not my opinion‚Äîit is just a scientific reality.
"Article 25: ""A standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of himself and of his family, including food, clothing, housing and medical care""

Do not let anybody try to tell you that health care and housing are not fundamental human rights."
"For the price of increasing Trump's Pentagon, Congress could provide all our children with free school meals and tuition-free public college.

Instead, we're voting on a $738-billion bill that lets Trump continue to help Saudi Arabia bomb Yemeni children."
Look around at the big-money interests spending millions of dollars on ads to confuse the American people. How will we beat them? Through the efforts of Medicare for All champions like @RepJayapal and @NationalNurses‚Äô Jean Ross. This is how we make health care a human right.
"It's no great secret Trump's FCC is a friend to corporate interests. That's why it set out to destroy a free and open internet. 

Mitch McConnell: make your case against net neutrality to the American people. But do not block the Senate from voting on the Save The Internet Act."
"Donald Trump is the most corrupt president in history, and he must be held accountable. I strongly believe the announcement of articles of impeachment are appropriate and necessary, and I call on the full House to pass them."
"Think about all of the intellectual and emotional damage we do because we ignore the needs of our children.

Under my legislation with @Ilhan, we invest in our young people, we nurture them, and we make sure all of our kids get free school meals."
"Congress must vote against this disastrous Pentagon authorization‚Äîa bill of astonishing moral cowardice. We do not need to shower Trump, his Saudi friends and the military-industrial complex with a $738-billion taxpayer giveaway."
"The Lower Drug Costs Now Act goes after Big Pharma's greed and makes important investments in community health centers and dental care for those on Medicare. @USProgressives are fighting to make this bill even stronger, and I support their efforts."
"As a young person, I protested the Vietnam war. Americans were lied to and sent to die.

After 18 years of lies and $1 trillion of war in Afghanistan, we are in the same place. We must end this war and build a society that stops this from happening again."
"Pharma giant @GileadSciences lies and cheats, then asks the government for tens of billions of dollars in monopoly profits.

@AOC and I demand that @uspto reject Gilead's endless greed. No one with HIV should have to die because they can't afford treatment."
"How can you have a decent life today when you're barely getting by? This is what our workers ask themselves: 44% are in low-wage jobs averaging $18,000 a year.

My bill makes $15 an hour the minimum wage, providing relief to 40 million struggling Americans."
"When 19-year-old, working-class kids go abroad, it‚Äôs to fight and die in Iraq and Afghanistan.
 
When Silicon Valley billionaires run abroad, they go to Bermuda to avoid paying their fair share of taxes. What patriotism! What love of country!"
"We cannot delay any longer: we must protect our oceans and the diversity of life that they provide for.

We will create millions of jobs building a sustainable economy to end the carbon emissions and run-off pollution that are devastating our seas."
"Here's a radical idea: Workers should be able to organize unions to fight for better pay and conditions without fear of intimidation, threats and often illegal behavior from their employers."
Amazon was valued at $1 trillion but pays $0 in federal taxes. So imagine my surprise to find out it didn‚Äôt need taxpayers to fork over billions in corporate welfare to create jobs in New York. @AOC and many others fighting for working people were right.
"In my view, it would be insane to argue that our criminal justice system is not racist, broken, and in need of serious reform."
"Public college tuition:
üá©üá∞ $0

üáÆüá∏ $0
üá≤üáΩ $0
 
üá∫üá∏ $10,230
 
Please do not tell me that in the richest country in the world, we cannot tax Wall Street to provide free higher education for all people‚Äîinstead of crushing them under mountains of debt."
"A greedy drug company deprives Americans of lifesaving HIV medicine, lies about it, then has the audacity to ask for a monopoly to make billions more in profit. What a disgrace.

I applaud the grassroots activists opposing this obscene corporate giveaway."
"Did you know we once had a Republican president who expanded Social Security? Maybe today's Republicans should listen to what he had to say about the program, instead of trying to destroy it."
"The average interest rate for a payday loan in Utah? 652%. 70-year-old Vietnam veterans are being jailed for not being able to keep up.

The Loan Shark Prevention Act, from @AOC and I, would put an end this disgusting greed."

"We take from the poor, we give to the rich: this is the philosophy of the modern Republican party."
"Who is helping keep Saudi Arabia‚Äôs warplanes in the air as they bomb Yemen‚Äîwhere children are dying of hunger in the worst humanitarian crisis on the planet?

The United States of America. That has got to stop."
"Wealth of the richest Americans: $35.4 trillion
Wealth of the entire American middle class: $36.9 trillion

Maybe, just maybe, it is time for Wall Street and the top 1 percent to start paying their fair share of taxes."
"Drug companies charge the American people whatever price they want, and they can because our system, and only ours, allows it.

It will not be an easy fight‚Äîno great struggle for justice is‚Äîbut working together, we will end the outrageous greed of Big Pharma."
End this war.
"On #CyberMonday, shoppers will rely on the U.S. Postal Service for fast, reliable, and affordable shipping. But Mr. Trump wants to privatize and destroy it.

These good-paying unionized jobs lifted families like @MrDannyGlover's into the middle class‚Äîwe must protect them."
"We are taking on the big-money interests who have an army of lobbyists trying to defeat Medicare for All. 
 
They are terrified that the American people recognize that health care is a human right. They're right to be terrified."
"More than a decade ago, advocates for working people warned that the WTO and unfettered free trade agreements would lead to the loss of millions of good-paying American jobs. Guess what? We were right."
"This is called oligarchy: government of, by, and for the billionaire class."
Our world is beautiful and fragile. We must put our energies into building the political power we need to solve the problem of climate change before it is too late.
"Trump and his friends weren't satisfied with giving away trillions of dollars to the rich‚Äînow they're trying to take food out of the mouths of a million needy schoolchildren across America.

We have got to stand together and defeat their disgusting agenda."
"Nearly half our college students are going hungry. The top 25 hedge-fund managers on average get $850 million a year‚Äîeach.

Wall Street‚Äôs greed wrecked the hopes and futures of an entire generation. So we will tax Wall Street to cancel all student debt and offer college for all."
"I stand in solidarity with Amazon warehouse workers demanding to be treated like human beings. They are sick and tired of the brutal working conditions, injuries, surveillance, and workplace deaths‚Äîall to fatten the pockets of a billion-dollar corporation."

If we do not end the pain and suffering of millions of Americans, we will condemn an entire generation to early death."
"When Trump vetoed our historic legislation to end the horrors in Yemen, the peace movement in this country did not give up‚Äîthey began mobilizing even more strongly.

@RepRoKhanna is absolutely right. This is how we are going to stop this unconstitutional war."
Senator Schumer is right. Congress has got to stand up for the Constitution and tell this lawless president: We are not giving you a Pentagon bill that allows you to partner with the despotic Saudi regime in its horrific war in Yemen.
"Some CEOs get paid more than 1,000 times their typical employee. Most Americans think the ratio should be 7 to 1.

If American corporations can't align closer with American values, then we are going to tax outrageous CEO pay until they do."
"This is a full-blown crisis and Trump is only making it worse. 

Congress must demonstrate the guts to take on the fossil fuel industry and declare a climate emergency."
"Trump, a tax dodger who abused and cheated his own workers, has done everything he can to get the government to enrich the billionaire class.

Any wonder why Amazon gets away with injuring its warehouse employees and paying $0 in federal taxes?"

The targeting and demonizing of undocumented people must end immediately."

That is not, to say the least, what this country is supposed to be about."
"The greed and impunity of the richest 1% is costing us $5,000,000,000,000.

"It is outrageous that Trump deployed American troops into harm's way to guard Syrian oil wells. Why? He said he wants to make a deal with ExxonMobil to sell that oil. 

This is illegal and unconstitutional. We must rein him in and stop these endless wars."
"Good. If we criminalize compassion, we have lost our way as a society. Providing humanitarian aid to men, women and children so that they do not die in the desert‚Äîwhether on the border or anywhere‚Äîis not a crime."
"How do you explain the mentality of the billionaire Sackler family? They weren't content to destroy thousands of lives for profit in America‚Äîthey had to push opioids on the people of China, too. 

The level of greed and cruelty is breathtaking."
"Today, we remember transgender people whose lives were taken. The attacks against transgender people are part of a bigotry which has got to end. To all transgender people I say: We stand with you. #TDOR"
"Latina workers lose $28,036 annually and $1,121,440 over 40 years compared to what white men make‚Äîbecause they are paid less. That's outrageous. This might be a ""radical"" idea, but maybe it's time for Latinas to get equal pay for equal work."
"Congratulations to activists for pushing the state to limit fracking in California. Fracking contributes to the climate crisis, increases earthquake risks and threatens our drinking water. Together, we can‚Äîand we will‚Äîban fracking nationwide."
All people have the right to protest for a better future. I call on the Iranian government to end the internet blackout and stop violence against demonstrators.
"When I was in the House of Representatives, all the corporations in the world were telling us how great NAFTA would be. I did not buy it. I was right.

I will not support any deal that makes American workers compete against people earning pennies an hour."
I agree with Representative Ilhan Omar: The answer to hate is not more hate; it is compassion.
"The top 1% owe 70% of unpaid taxes. Collecting less than a third of those taxes can fund all of this:

üéì Tuition-free college for all
üè° A Green New Deal for public housing
üö∞ Clean tap water for all
üçù Universal school meals

Don't tell me we can't afford to live with dignity."
"If my memory is correct, this is exactly what the #NoDAPL movement warned about. It is why I stood with them in 2011 to oppose the expansion of the Keystone pipeline. 

We must clean up this disaster and immediately transition away from fossil fuels to renewable energy."
"I oppose the intervention of Bolivia's security forces in the democratic process and their repression of Indigenous protesters. When the military intervened and asked President Evo Morales to leave, in my view, that‚Äôs called a coup."
"Israeli settlements in occupied territory are illegal. This is clear from international law and multiple United Nations resolutions. Once again, Mr. Trump is isolating the United States and undermining diplomacy by pandering to his extremist base."
The system is rigged against working people.
Looking for a paid internship with Senator Sanders? Are you a student or recent graduate? Apply to be a full-time intern in my D.C. office.
The American people are united on issue after issue. We must legalize marijuana now‚Äîand expunge all past marijuana convictions as a matter of racial and economic justice.
"Where did the money from Trump's ""tax cuts for the middle class"" go? To wealthy corporations who have spent $1 trillion buying back their own stock to enrich executives and wealthy shareholders. That's not acceptable."
"Trump's federal government won't tackle climate change, improve public housing, or create unionized renewable and retrofitting jobs.

The solution to these challenges, in my view, is both possible and necessary: we need a Green New Deal for Public Housing."
"Observing the laws of war is essential to our national security. President Trump pardoned and absolved these soldiers yesterday, overruling his own top security officials. This is wrong and disrespectful to those serving honorably. It makes us less safe."
"I am proud to have fought over the years for the idea that health care is a human right‚Äînot a privilege. When we pass Medicare for All, it will be because millions of people, over decades, created an unstoppable grassroots movement for justice."
"The Gap corporation didn‚Äôt give a damn about struggling workers as it showered its failing CEO with millions of dollars a year. 

We will no longer tolerate socialism for the rich and powerful. Congress must pass our Tax Excessive CEO Pay Act."
"This decision by the parole board is critically important. Rodney Reed's execution should not just be delayed, but canceled.

Real criminal justice reform must include joining every other major democracy in eliminating the death penalty."
"The biggest threats that we face today‚Äîclimate change, inequality, rising authoritarianism, and a refugee crisis‚Äîdo not have military solutions.

It's time to stop spending trillions on endless wars and get to work on things that will help America succeed for future generations."
"Trump should be impeached and he will be impeached. But that does not mean we neglect the other crises facing this country, whether it is the housing crisis or climate change. We are mature enough as a nation to walk and chew bubble gum at the same time."
"Can anyone possibly defend taking away lunch from little kids? Would my GOP colleagues care to work with me and @IlhanMN to end these outrageous stories?

We have a bill that wipes out school lunch debt and makes free school meals universal. Let's pass it."
"I thank public housing residents for sharing their stories with us today about their struggles and what green jobs could do for their communities. 

I am more committed than ever to work with @AOC to pass a Green New Deal and make dignified housing a human right."
"Sen. Sanders, Rep. Ocasio-Cortez, and climate and housing activists lay out how we will transform public housing to create hundreds of thousands of green jobs."
"It is truly outrageous that at the very same time the Santa Clarita school shooting was happening, Senate Republicans‚Äîled by Mitch McConnell‚Äîrefused to pass gun safety legislation.

Congress and Trump must finally have the courage to stand up to the NRA. Enough is enough!"
Let us not forget: Climate change is the existential crisis of our time. This is the moment for bold action to empower the frontline communities who are most affected as we transform our energy system. This is how we prevent irreparable harm to our planet.
"You‚Äôre right, @RepAOC. We will ensure a dignified life, with parks, gardens, and community centers, for our public housing residents. We invest $172 billion in retrofits that improve health, safety and comfort‚Äîwhile eliminating all carbon emissions in our public housing."
"How many jobs are we talking about?
 
üìà Nearly 250,000 good-paying, family-sustaining, union jobs per year across the country if this goes through.

üöô At the same time, we reduce carbon pollution on the scale of taking 1.2 million cars off the road over 10 years."
"I am delighted to be standing with @RepAOC, public housing residents, and climate activists to introduce the Green New Deal for Public Housing today. We must boldly take on the housing and climate crises and create millions of jobs."
"Rep. Tlaib is exactly right. And if these corporations insist on paying their CEOs hundreds of times more than their workers, we will tax them at rate high enough to fund the creation of 230,000 clean energy jobs."
"Today, I am proud to introduce the Tax Excessive CEO Pay Act with @RepBarbaraLee and @RepRashida. If corporations can't understand why it's absurd to pay their CEOs more in a year than their workers will earn in a lifetime, then maybe this bill will help them figure it out."
"The student debt crisis is only getting worse. If we can bail out Wall Street banks after they destroyed the U.S. economy, do not tell me we cannot bail out 40 million people whose only crime is trying to get a higher education."
"Trump's attack on the DACA program is the ugliest and most cruel decision made by a president in our modern history.

I will do everything I possibly can to protect Dreamers from being thrown out of the only country they have ever known."
What kind of society do we live in when a mother is charged nearly $1 million by her employer-based insurance for the birth of her own child? The health care system is broken. We need Medicare for All.
"If you think it is too expensive to take care of our veterans, don't send them to war."
"On Veterans Day, let us renew our promise to returned service members by ending the injustices that too many of them face, such as homelessness, loneliness, and deportations. We must also strengthen the VA so that veterans and their families get the support they deserve."
"A retail worker who misses a shift because of an emergency can be fired on the spot. 

But what happened when Gap's CEO oversaw sales and stock declines? He got a 33% pay raise and made $20 million a year‚Äî3,500 times more than his workers. Obscene."
"50 years ago, every dollar of an estate over $10 million was taxed at a rate of 77 percent. Since then, wealthy elites have worked to gut the estate tax‚Äîand inequality has exploded. 

Our job: Bring back this critical tool to stop the rise of oligarchy."
"In the richest country in the world, no child should be poisoned by contaminated water coming through their faucet. What has gone on in Flint, where 30,000 kids have been exposed to neurotoxins, is a crime and an obscenity."
"We have got to join the rest of the developed world and abolish the death penalty. Too many innocent people, particularly people of color, get caught up in this unjust policy. A civilized society should not be involved in the murder of other Americans."
"Despite GOP efforts to sabotage health care for millions of Americans, the Affordable Care Act is still the law.

Spread the word: You can sign up for health insurance today. Open enrollment runs until December 15. Go to  to choose a plan and get covered."
"Philadelphia police stopped 25,000 cars because they ""smelled marijuana."" 

84% were African American drivers. They found marijuana only 12% of the time.

Our job must be to end the War on Drugs‚Äîand get racial bias out of law enforcement at the same time."
"Seven decades ago, the British people put in place a system that treats health care as a human right. Today they live longer than Americans, infant mortality is lower, and they spend half of what we do on health care.

It‚Äôs time we join the rest of the industrialized world."
"Mr. Trump said he'd fight for a trade policy to help American workers. He said he'd lower the trade deficit. He lied: It's gone up.
 
His real agenda: Protect the profits of the pharmaceutical industry and make it easier for corporations to outsource jobs."
"Nicole Smith-Holt‚Äôs son Alec died at 26 because he was rationing insulin that was too expensive. Every day, Americans are suffering and dying because of the greed of Big Pharma. We need to share these stories and stand together to fight back."
"Facebook has incredible power over the economy and our political life. It harvests the data of 228 million Americans and, over and over, uses this sensitive information in dangerous ways. What we need is vigorous antitrust action and to break Facebook up."
"3.2 million more people are in poverty than official statistics show‚Äîhow? Inflation is higher for the poorest than it is for the average person.

This is more evidence of what we already know: the economy is rigged and it benefits the wealthiest the most."
"Now, thanks to the FCC under Mr. Trump, many Americans will only be able to choose from three huge corporations for their wireless service: Verizon, AT&amp;T, and T-Mobile.
 
This trend of unending corporate consolidation goes against the interests of consumers and our democracy."
"11,258 scientists from 153 countries came together to say: ""Scientists have a moral obligation to clearly warn humanity of any catastrophic threat and tell it like it is."" 
 
It's time we listen. Congress must declare a climate emergency and act boldly to protect our only home."
"Republicans all over the country are trying to make it harder for people of color, poor people, and older people to participate in our democracy. 

Our agenda:
üó≥Ô∏è Extend early voting
üåÉ Extend voting hours
üá∫üá∏ Make #ElectionDay a holiday"
"If Trump was serious about a solution to the horrendous conflict in Yemen, he would have signed our War Powers Resolution into law and ended illegal military support to the Saudis. Instead, he vetoed it. 

Thousands of Yemeni children have died on his watch."
"Iran's resumption of work at Fordow is a concerning step. We had a deal in place that capped Iran‚Äôs nuclear program, which Trump recklessly violated. We should rejoin the JCPOA immediately and talk to Iran about other regional issues."
"During his campaign, Trump said over and over again that he would stick it to the wealthy by closing the egregious carried interest loophole. Guess what? His disgraceful tax bill did nothing to address it and even Fox Business commentators are fed up with his broken promises."
"Secretary Pompeo, I hate to break it to you, but plunging the world in to a full-scale climate catastrophe is nothing to be proud of."
"Well, what do you know? One of the Wall Street ratings agencies complicit in the worst financial crash in modern history is warning of the dangers of bailing out students‚Äînot the crooks who run the big banks. 
 
Thanks for the advice. But we are going to cancel all student debt."
"Here‚Äôs an idea: How about an agenda that isn‚Äôt about corporate trade deals that sell out our workers, tax cuts for billionaires, and endless war? 

For once let‚Äôs focus on dignity for the working class. Let‚Äôs create millions of good jobs to take care of each other and our planet."
"‚òÄÔ∏èSolar‚Äî¬¢4.3/kWh
üí®Wind‚Äî¬¢4.2/kWh
üõ¢Coal‚Äî¬¢10/kWh
‚ò¢Ô∏èNuclear‚Äî¬¢15/kWh
 
As renewable costs fall, there is no technological obstacle to transforming our energy system to create millions of good jobs. What we need now is the political will for a Green New Deal."
"Trump is a good example that if you put your mind to it and work hard, you can betray just about every promise you make and deny every reality that exists."
All of us can be a little forgetful sometimes. My Republican friends launched trillion-dollar wars and passed huge tax cuts for the rich. Then they ask why the deficit went up.
"Congratulations to the UK‚Äôs grassroots activists for successfully banning fracking. We know fracking contaminates our water. We know it pollutes the air we breathe. We know it fuels climate change. 

Together, we can‚Äîand we will‚Äîban fracking in America, too."
"How do we pay for quality health care, guaranteed to all our people? Pretty simple, in my view. The way every other rich country does. #MedicareForAll"
"Since 2011, I opposed the KeystoneXL pipeline. I feared that more dirty tar sands oil infrastructure would lead to disastrous spills. 

As 380,000 gallons of crude oil contaminate North Dakota's rural wetlands, we have got to say: Enough. It's time for a Green New Deal."
"What if the media told the American people every day that the richest 400 billionaires pay lower taxes than the middle class and the working poor? 

What if, when politicians say we must make do with less, the media admitted we're being played for suckers?"
"I voted against the Patriot Act. It created an Orwellian system of mass surveillance. We must now end the NSA's unconstitutional data collection on hundreds of millions of calls. Intelligence agencies cannot unjustly surveil activists, Muslim Americans, and people of color."
"I applaud @CTULocal1's teachers for achieving better pay, smaller class sizes, and more nurses and social workers in Chicago's schools. This is what solidarity is about‚Äîfighting for the whole community. 
 
When workers stand together, I have no doubt we will transform America."
"Jeff Bezos' income per day: $215 million
Federal taxes Amazon pays: $0
Amazon's spending to buy Seattle's City Council: $1.6 million

The only way we take back our democracy and end this obscene system of oligarchy is by standing up and fighting back."
"Mr. Trump, the American people read the call summary.

That is why the House is voting to proceed with an impeachment inquiry at this very moment."
"In Chile, a billionaire president pushes austerity while the military represses protesters. Thousands have been arrested. Knowing Chile's history, this is very dangerous.
 
The solution here and across the world is obvious. Put power where it belongs: with working people."
"Unions don't just mean better wages and benefits. Workers organize to protect each other from abusive bosses, harassment and discrimination. 
 
I stand in solidarity with these employees fighting for a fair workplace on behalf of all workers at NBC."
"CEO-to-worker pay gaps:

Gap, Inc.: 3,566 to 1
McDonald's: 2,124 to 1
Disney: 1,424 to 1
Walmart: 1,076 to 1

When the middle class is rebuilt, we will look back on this period in history and say, ""This was wrong. Why on Earth did we allow this kind of grotesque inequality?"""

"I‚Äôm from Brooklyn. New York wouldn‚Äôt be one of the greatest cities in the world without the 40,000 transit workers @TWULocal100 who run the bus and subway systems. They keep New York moving and deserve a fair contract with good wages, benefits and job security. #TWURally2019"
"The death toll in Yemen's war could grow to 230,000 by the year's end. Trump vetoed our bill to stop U.S. military involvement, but Congress can still prohibit it. And we must.
 
I look forward to working with Armed Services Ranking Member Reed to end this humanitarian nightmare."
Access to a safe and legal abortion is a constitutional right.
"Surviving a wildfire is like experiencing hell on Earth. If we know that climate change makes these fires more frequent and widespread, why aren't we working together to pass a Green New Deal?"
It‚Äôs been over 10 years since the federal minimum wage was raised to $7.25 an hour and over 100 days since the House passed the Raise the Wage Act. No American should be in poverty. Workers need a living wage. Mr. McConnell: do your duty and bring the bill to the Senate floor.
"On #NationalImmigrantsDay, I am proud of our country for welcoming millions around the world seeking refuge from violence, racism and poverty‚Äîpeople like my father who came here from Poland at the age of 17.

This is the America that we must be."
This is what a climate emergency looks like. We must bring the full weight of the federal government to bear to help the people of California. We need to deal with the impacts that are already here and act decisively to prevent a much bigger catastrophe.
"The time has come to fulfill and expand upon FDR‚Äôs vision that he laid out 75 years ago.

These are not radical ideas. They're supported by the majority of Americans. Working together, we can and must achieve economic, social, racial, political and environmental justice for all."
Abu Bakr al Baghdadi was a murderer and terrorist responsible for terrible suffering and death. The fight against ISIS would not be possible without the brave efforts of the Kurds and other U.S. allies.
"African-Americans are almost 4 times as likely to have force used on them by police‚Äîthis is unacceptable. The time is long overdue for us to end ""stop and frisk"" practices, demilitarize our police departments, and reform our racist criminal justice system."
"The richest 400 billionaires pay lower taxes than everyone else. In my view, this obscene inequality in wealth and political power is not compatible with a democratic society. I am proud to support the introduction of the For The 99.8% Act in the House by @RepJimmyGomez."
How can we talk about problems of crime without mentioning that we have one of the highest rates of childhood poverty in the industrialized world? Building all the jails in the world will not make this right.
"Mr. President, this is the exact opposite of what halting endless war looks like. Congress has not authorized you to use our troops to secure Syria‚Äôs oil.

Read the Constitution, Article I."
"I've said it before: Betsy DeVos is the worst Secretary of Education in modern history. Instead of standing up for victims of fraud, she is profiting off of them. Our country needs an advocate for students, not a billionaire working on behalf of predatory lenders."
"Life-threatening diseases linked to Agent Orange are afflicting 83,000 veterans of the Vietnam War‚Äîand the White House refuses to cover their care. This is outrageous.
 
@SenatorTester and I are demanding these veterans get the coverage they deserve now. No more excuses."
"It is unfortunate that Trump officials have to resign in order to shed light on the huge debt burden for students. We must cancel student loan debt‚Äîbut not just some of it. All $1,675,469,158,747."
Right-wing extremists in every state and every branch of government have worked for decades to make it more and more difficult for women to access abortion. We cannot let them win. Abortion is a constitutional right that must be protected.
"This major settlement will benefit the people of Vermont, who have been hurt and misled by opioid distributors like Reckitt. I am proud of our state‚Äôs Attorney General for taking the fight to the pharmaceutical industry, and winning."
"The average cost of 4-year college in the United States: $23,091 
The average cost of 4-year college in France: $212
 
Education is one of the keys to a successful democracy, so why are we making it so hard for our people to learn?"
"We are putting corporate America on notice: treat your workers with fairness and dignity.

When workers strike and secure better wages and benefits, we embolden workers everywhere to stand up and fight too.

This is how we rebuild our middle class."
Let‚Äôs be absolutely clear about what Republicans are doing by adding new paperwork and requirements to Medicaid: they are attacking the poor and threatening lives.
"President Trump announced he will keep troops in Syria to protect oil fields. Last I checked, Congress never authorized U.S. forces to be deployed to secure Syria‚Äôs economic resources. Putting U.S. forces in harm‚Äôs way for this purpose is illegal and unconstitutional."
"It is completely unacceptable for a quid pro quo regarding personal political goals to determine the conduct of U.S. foreign policy.
 
The House should continue its impeachment inquiry and expose the full nature of the most corrupt presidency in modern history."
"Big surprise: the president is a liar. Far from ""ending the endless wars,"" Mr. Trump has ended no wars and deployed more troops to the Middle East."
"The Arab Spring rose up to fight corruption, repression, inequality and austerity. The Lebanon and Iraq protests show this spirit is still very much alive. If we want a progressive future, we need to build up a global movement of and for working people."
"No, Mr. Trump. ‚ÄúLynching‚Äù was a campaign of racial terror by white supremacists who murdered thousands of African-American men, women, and children. If you are nervous about an impeachment process, then you should not have violated the Constitution."
"I think it is pretty sick to knowingly sell a product that will destroy the planet and our children's futures, but that is the mindset of a fossil fuel billionaire. It's time for a Green New Deal and an end to this disease of lying for profit."
"It turns out that when you put people over profits, society is better off."
"In one of the wealthiest countries in the history of the world, no one should be in poverty. The current $7.25 an hour federal minimum wage is a starvation wage and must be increased to a living wage of $15 an hour. 

Time for the Senate to do its job and take a vote."
"Congratulations to the Burlington High School women's soccer team on taking this courageous step. I myself am a baseball fan, but no matter the sport, I hope all fans and athletes can agree on this: Equal pay for equal work, full stop."
"The Supreme Court just allowed Michigan to continue gerrymandering districts to benefit Republicans.

Our job: Fight back. Expand voter turnout. Make state legislatures and courts end partisan gerrymandering. Overturn Citizens United. Create a vibrant democracy."
"Mr. Trump's NAFTA 2.0 will not stop the outsourcing of jobs I warned against on the picket lines in 1993.

We need a trade policy that ends the race to the bottom, not another one of Trump‚Äôs corporate giveaways."
"For vulture fund CEO Paul Singer, it seems having $3.5 billion is not enough. He is now trying to profit from taking AT&amp;T workers' jobs, wages and benefits. 

@RoKhanna and @CWAUnion are right. We must tell the Paul Singers of the world: Enough is enough."
"""School lunch debt"" is not a phrase that should exist.

@Ilhan and I want to eliminate all of it."
"This American woman experienced what it's like to have universal health care in the UK, and guess what? Now she doesn't want to move back to the United States."
"Imagine cancelling all student debt and making every public college tuition-free, so that the rich aren't vacationing off the backs of struggling students. 
 
Now stop imagining. Let's tax Wall Street and do it."
"Billy Foister was one of 125,000 Americans toiling in Amazon's warehouses for Jeff Bezos‚Äîa billionaire who makes $150,000 per minute. Just sickening. @OSHA_DOL must launch a comprehensive investigation now."
"Purdue Pharma used its wealth, power, and army of lawyers to bully West Virginia officials and get away with murder. 

Who has to live with the consequences of opioid executives' greed? Thousands of innocent kids now in foster homes and emergency shelters."
"If we make lunch free for all kids, kids do better in school. It‚Äôs as simple as that. To ensure that all kids are prepared to be successful, now is the time to make all school meals universal."
"Congratulations to our neighbors to the north on completing their first year of marijuana legalization! Vermont shares a border with Canada, and as far as I can tell, the sky has not fallen and the cities have not plunged into anarchy on the other side."
"If we do not pass a Green New Deal, Mr. Trump's resort is likely to be swallowed by sea-level rise before the century ends because of catastrophic climate change.

Maybe when it is underwater he'll have a harder time calling global warming a ""hoax."""
"‚ÄúHow can we afford it?‚Äù

It‚Äôs a question critics ask any time I propose a bold new program like College for All. The answer in this case is very simple: with a small fee on Wall Street that will end reckless financial speculation."
"Jane and I are deeply saddened by the loss of our good  friend, Rep. Elijah Cummings. I was honored to work closely with him over the years. His integrity and moral vision for his community and the country were extraordinary."
"The greed of opioid manufacturers has taken hundreds of thousands of lives, and the epidemic they created cost us $631 billion over the past four years alone.

Now they're cutting a deal to pay $18 billion for their wrongdoing. Outrageous."
"Let us be very clear: Medicare for All will boost pay and benefits for workers across this country. That's why unions are organizing to get rid of corporate greed in our health care system. 
 
Thank you, @RepJayapal and @RepDebDingell, for your strong leadership in this fight."
"In our system of government, Congress alone controls government spending. And we did not give Trump the money to waste on his damn wall. 

I say this with no great pleasure, but we have a President of the United States who has not read, or does not understand, the Constitution."
"The ecological crisis has gotten worse and worse, decade after decade, and yet the corporate media still refuse to take it seriously.

We will not bring about the political change needed to tackle the climate emergency until we address this."
"I am proud to unveil, with Rep. @Ilhan Omar, a bill to ensure that every child in America has access to school meals.

In the richest country in the history of the world, we must not tolerate the obscenity of kids going hungry while they're trying to learn."
"The national security experts who led this letter are exactly right: Congress must block taxpayer dollars from funding this illegal war. We have a chance to not only end the suffering of Yemenis, but ensure that America is never again embroiled in another unconstitutional war."
"I applaud Ecuador‚Äôs Indigenous-led grassroots movements who stood up to repression and blocked the IMF's austerity agenda. 

Economic elites keep pushing austerity worldwide, making life unbearable for working people. The U.S. should stop supporting this."
I don't accept people hiding behind the American flag to give tax breaks to the rich and throw billions upon billions of dollars at the military-industrial complex. Who is patriotic and who is not? It's an interesting question.
"Trump is working to:
‚Ä¢ enable corporate tax evasion
‚Ä¢ let factories dump toxic chemicals into wetlands
‚Ä¢ limit food inspections 
‚Ä¢ collect debt from defrauded students
‚Ä¢ increase car pollution

This is the most corrupt presidency in modern history."
"This phony ‚Äúanti-war‚Äù president vetoed our bill to get American troops out of the illegal war in Yemen. He has ignored Congress‚Äôs power to declare war. He‚Äôs spent years intensifying Middle East conflicts without giving a damn about the Constitution.

Trump is a liar and a fraud."
"When I reflect on how this country passed Social Security in 1935 and Medicare in 1965, I think about how much poverty and suffering we ended.

Our next step is Medicare for All. When we succeed, future generations will appreciate how we made health care a human right in America."
"Some argue that the U.S. is not really engaged in hostilities in Yemen. But when Yemenis see ""Made in USA"" on the bombs killing their children, it‚Äôs very clear that the United States is part of this horrible war. This must end."
This is exactly right. Wage theft is a crime and workers should stand up to it. We need a powerful labor movement to end the obscenity of businesses robbing billions of dollars from their own employees every year.
"Inequality is at a 100-year high. 400 billionaires pay lower taxes than fast-food workers. Wages have gone nowhere.

The power elite need to come clean. Admit to the American people that the trickle-down economics you've sold us for 40 years is a racket."
"Very proud of Vermont and other jurisdictions for leading the way. This is a critical victory for immigrants across the United States, who should never have to fear risking their status in order to access basic services."
"Remember when Donald Trump tweeted that he was ""trying to end the endless wars?"" That was yesterday. 

Today he's sending thousands of troops, warplanes, and missiles to his dictator friends in Saudi Arabia to escalate military tensions with Iran."
"Trump's Pentagon is run by a former Raytheon lobbyist. So of course an official who successfully eliminated billions in Pentagon waste and abuse was forced out. 

It's time to slash our bloated military budget and use the savings to solve real human needs."
"Climate strikers, led by our young people, are on the march for environmental justice. They are changing our national conversation and building an unstoppable movement. Together, we will transform this country and pass a Green New Deal."
"I believe decent housing, good health care, and a quality education are human rights that everyone should have. 

Under our ruthless economic system, they are commodities whose costs keep rising as Americans‚Äô wages stagnate. 

This is why we fight."
"Think of the alternative to these power outages and intense wildfires if America tackles climate change. 

We can build a smart, safe, and modern electrical grid that gives every American access to clean, cheap, and reliable energy from renewables."
"Almost half of all Americans will experience a mental illness during their lifetime. We have to take care of one another. In the wealthiest nation in the world, all of us, regardless of income, should have access to mental health care as a right. #WorldMentalHealthDay"
"I noticed, and I'm pretty damn sure patients with breast cancer and their families will notice too."
"I have long believed that democracy isn't just voting every four years‚Äîit‚Äôs about ordinary people creating community, engaging in the political process together, and building powerful grassroots movements to achieve progressive change. And that‚Äôs exactly what we‚Äôre doing."
"I condemn Trump's reckless decision to abandon our Kurdish allies to their fate at the hands of Turkish President Erodogan.

The President of the United States should not make significant national security decisions impulsively, by tweet, after a single phone call."
"In America today, we are overpaying for subpar health care. Why? Corporate greed.

Medicare for All would save both dollars and lives. It is time that we finally join every other major country in the world and guarantee health care for all."
"I say, with @MrDannyGlover, to Trump: We will not let you destroy a generational source of good, unionized jobs for the African-American community. We should modernize and expand the U.S. Postal Service to offer basic banking solutions‚Äînot privatize it."
I applaud the activists whose efforts led the Trump Organization to cancel this event. Anti-Muslim bigotry has no place in American political life.
"Think of how broken our economic system is. A warehouse worker whose bathroom break goes too long gets threatened with being fired. 

A typical consequence for a CEO who runs a corporation to the ground? Millions of more dollars in salary and bonuses."
"If the Supreme Court wants to be on the right side of history, it must recognize that transgender people are entitled to the same civil and human rights as everybody else. Period."
"We now know the richest 400 Americans have rigged the system to pay lower taxes than everyone else in the country.

The question of our time is this: will we tolerate it? Or will we take back our democracy from the oligarchs who run this country?"
I have long believed the U.S. must responsibly end our military interventions in the Middle East. But Trump‚Äôs abrupt announcement to withdraw from northern Syria and endorse Turkey‚Äôs incursion is extremely irresponsible. It is likely to result in more suffering and instability.
"I am glad to be home in Burlington to rest for a little bit. I want to thank all of you for your well wishes, love, and support over the week. I am recovering well and feeling much better. 

I am more determined than ever to fight alongside you to make health care a human right."
"For over a year, Haitians have demonstrated against government corruption and rising costs. As protests grow, I am concerned about increased violence. Using live ammunition against protesters and journalists violates basic human rights and is unacceptable."
"This ruling threatens to give more power to unaccountable companies like AT&amp;T, Comcast and Verizon over what we see and do on the internet. 

We must fight to keep the internet free and open‚Äînot dominated by corporations. This struggle is essential to free speech and democracy."
"The American people are not falling for billionaires' anti-worker propaganda. Support for unions is near a 50-year high. 

More unions will rebuild the middle class, combat corporate greed, and ensure that workers get their fair share. The labor movement makes our country strong."
"The greed of Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, Citigroup and BlackRock is insatiable. Who cares if the Saudis are starving millions of Yemeni civilians or that our planet faces a climate emergency? Profiting off of $1.5 trillion in Saudi oil is just too important."
"CEOs say they want to make a social impact. Here's a way to do that: Instead of making 300 times more than their employees, maybe they should raise workers' wages and try getting by on 30 times more. Top CEOs in America did this not so long ago and somehow managed to survive."
A Green New Deal isn't just about the climate‚Äîit is about preventing hunger and illness. The time for incremental change has passed. We must fight to rapidly transform our energy system.
Alec Smith died at 26 because he was rationing insulin that was too expensive. Corporate greed is taking the lives of Americans and it needs to end now.
Tax Wall Street and cancel it.
"This behavior toward @RepJayapal as she performed her House duties is unacceptable. 

I voted against creating ICE because I feared the agency and its leaders would act with impunity. We need an immigration system that respects human rights and Congress's oversight authority."
We have got to get to the bottom of this. The American people have a right to know what deals Trump might be making with the murderous Saudi dictator that he loves so much.
"The undemocratic fiscal control board of Puerto Rico is still working hand in hand with Wall Street, with a plan for more austerity and slashed pensions. The board must stop dictating Puerto Rico‚Äôs economic decisions and let the people decide their future."
"Today, millions of climate strikers, led by a global youth movement, showed politicians around the world that the demand for environmental justice is not going away. It is only growing stronger. Together, we will pass a Green New Deal."
Mr. Trump made a series of disastrous choices this week‚Äîdecisions that tear at the fabric of what this country is about. This is one of them. We must not turn our backs on refugees fleeing horrific violence and persecution around the world.
This Republican mayor leads the first city in Texas powered by 100% renewable energy. Addressing climate change and creating millions of good-paying jobs in the process should not be a partisan issue.
"Make no mistake about it: Canceling student debt is an act of social, racial and economic justice."
It is the right of all people to protest for a better future. The Egyptian government should refrain from violence against protesters exercising this right. The world is watching.
"Inequality in America is at its worst level in more than 50 years. Maybe‚Äîjust maybe‚Äîit's time we start taxing the super-rich to ensure human rights for all Americans: housing, health care, education, retirement, good jobs, and a livable planet."
"As a corporate lawyer and lobbyist, Eugene Scalia made millions working for Chevron, Goldman Sachs, Facebook and other huge corporations, helping them undermine health and safety regulations. 
 
So naturally he's Trump's pick to lead the Labor Department. Obscene."
"Medicare for All will lower overall health care costs. Meanwhile:

üìàFamily premiums are up 54%‚Äî$20,000 a year
üìàDeductibles up 162%‚Äî$1,655 a year

But I'm sure the American people getting robbed blind by the insurance industry are just thrilled these costs aren't called ""taxes."""
There is a metaphorical wildfire happening in our oceans that will devastate our planet‚Äôs marine ecosystems and coastal communities. We must immediately take aggressive action to address this global emergency before it is too late.
Trump's cruelty and xenophobia never stops: ICE wants to send women and moms back to a for-profit detention center where there is a pattern of suicide and abuse. I support the efforts of @RAICESTEXAS and other organizers to prevent this from happening.
"The President has left the House of Representatives no choice but to begin an impeachment inquiry. I believe impeachable offenses were committed, and the House will now lay out the case. No president is above the law, and it is our responsibility to safeguard the Constitution."
"Trump is depriving 500,000 kids of their school lunches for no damn reason‚Äîeven after 139 members of Congress warned him not to. 

I cannot begin to understand the casual cruelty that motivates Trump and his billionaire friends to harm vulnerable children like this."
"The White House sent us their talking points around President Trump‚Äôs Ukraine call.

For some strange reason, they forgot to mention that Mr. Trump said, ‚ÄúI would like you to do us a favor though‚Äù after Zelensky brought up military aid."
"A message to Wall Street: We will investigate your corruption. We will not let you cut the schools, hospitals and pensions that the Puerto Rican people need to live with dignity and recover from Hurricane Maria."
".@AOC and I stand with the Puerto Ricans who flooded into the streets to demand democratic control over their lives. 
 
Puerto Rico's working families have suffered enough austerity. It's time to impose some austerity on the banks destroying the island."
"When Mr. Trump blames immigrants for crime, he spreading a racist lie.

Instead of frightening 11 million undocumented people with deportation, we need comprehensive immigration reform and a path to citizenship."
"While Trump and the GOP cut taxes for the top 1%, they want to return us to a time when workers could not engage in collective bargaining.
 
Unions are the backbone of America's middle class. Graduate student workers must have the right to join a union and earn a living wage."
What a disgrace that it takes a 16-year-old to tell world leaders what they won't acknowledge: We cannot continue with this type of ruthless capitalism that is destroying our planet. This is why we need young people leading our climate justice movement.
"Today is Native American Women‚Äôs Equal Pay Day, which marks how long a Native woman has to work into 2019 to catch up to the same amount a white man made in 2018. We must continue the fight for pay parity. This is not a radical issue, this is an issue of fairness and justice."
"General Motors made $11 billion last year. Their CEO was paid $22 million, nearly 300 times as much as their median worker.

The workers who make GM‚Äôs success possible deserve health care and good wages. I know which side I'm on."
"Trump calls Egypt's Sisi his 'favorite dictator.'

I believe the United States should stand for human rights, especially with governments that receive large amounts of US aid, as Egypt does. All people have the right to protest for a better future. Sisi should respect that right."
"Dwight D. Eisenhower was not a radical socialist‚Äîhe was a Republican. And in 1961, he tried to warn us about the ""military industrial complex."""
"I am proud to stand with these civil rights organizations. In the fight for marijuana legalization, we must prioritize racial and economic justice‚Äîthat means revenues from this industry must be invested in the communities that have been devastated by the so-called ""war on drugs."""
What gives me hope right now is this new generation of young people who dream big and do not want to settle for the status quo. #ClimateStrike
"For too long, the mainstream media has ignored science and given a platform to climate change deniers. I am glad they are finally starting to give this issue the attention it deserves, and I am calling on them to continue shedding light on the seriousness of this global crisis."
"It is unconscionable that amid global climate protests, tech giants like Microsoft are announcing major partnerships with Big Oil.

We must hold them accountable, demand they break ties with the fossil fuel industry, and move rapidly to sustainable energy."
Young people have already demonstrated they can take on powerful fossil fuel companies and force politicians to answer their call to action. To the millions of young people and allies worldwide who are striking today to demand climate justice: I stand with you. #ClimateStrike
"As thousands of people take to the streets today to demand bold climate change solutions, people in Texas are facing serious flooding. Our thoughts are with the people in southeast Texas. We will do everything we can to help those communities recover."
"Two years ago, Hurricane Mar√≠a‚Äîfueled by climate change‚Äîdevastated Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.
 
Our message for the people of those islands: you are not forgotten. We will fight for you, as American citizens, to fully rebuild for a sustainable and resilient future."
"99% of applications for loan forgiveness in this program are being rejected. The Department of Education is failing our public service workers and students.
 
Our job:
- Stand up to Betsy DeVos and the predatory lenders
- Cancel student debt and make public colleges tuition-free"
"A U.S. airstrike was intended for ISIS, but killed 30 Afghan civilians. This is just one of the horrors of endless war. ISIS did not even exist when America invaded Afghanistan 18 years ago.
 
We need to end our longest war and bring our troops home."
"Think of how corrupt our political and economic system truly is. Instead of worrying about jail time, the billionaire culprits of America's opioid crisis have the audacity to ask for millions in bonuses for their top employees.

We need a political revolution in this country."
"Ady is fighting two difficult battles at once: one against the horrific disease of ALS, and another against the insatiable greed of the insurance and drug companies. When we pass Medicare for All, it will be because of heroes like him who stood up and fought back."
This is why we need Medicare for All.
".@SecPompeo: An attack on Saudi oil is NOT an attack on America. If you want a war, come to Congress to make your case. We will not let you drag the American people into another catastrophe in the Middle East.

Your job is to use diplomacy to resolve conflict‚Äînot incite more war."
"U.S. trade agreements should stop the outsourcing of jobs, end the race to the bottom, protect the environment and lower the outrageously high price of prescription drugs. 

@RepDebDingell is right: Trump‚Äôs NAFTA 2.0 falls far short of those standards."
"Trump says he loves business and states' rights. Except when automakers and the state of California worked together to reduce car emissions. 

How sick do you have to be, in the face of a climate emergency, to have your EPA block this effort to cut tailpipe pollution?"
".@HasanMinhaj is right. Instead of just worrying about Wall Street, maybe it's time we start worrying about the 45 million Americans with $1.6 trillion in student debt. We could start by canceling it."
"""I am alive today not because of insurance companies but despite them.""
 
We are the only major country that allows private insurance companies to rip us off, rob us of our health, and drive our people into financial or emotional catastrophe."
"Congratulations to the students pushing the University of California to join more than a thousand institutions in divesting from fossil fuels. If we want to leave future generations a planet that is healthy and habitable, we must transform our energy system to sustainable energy."
"Average cost of a C-section:

üá´üá∑ $6,441

üá∫üá∏ $15,041

We can afford Medicare for All. What we can't afford is continuing to charge women in the U.S. more than any other country for giving birth."
"As many as 22 million people‚Äîdouble the populations of New York City and Chicago combined‚Äîcould be displaced by global warming this year. 

When we say that climate change is an emergency, this is what @AOC, @RepBlumenauer and I are talking about."
"What are our priorities when it takes 10 years to get food insecurity back down to a level before Wall Street crashed the economy?

1 in 9 families still go hungry in the world's richest country. If we are to end hunger, ordinary people must get involved in the political process."
"Mr. Trump, the Constitution of the United States is perfectly clear. Only Congress‚Äînot the president‚Äîcan declare war. And Congress will not give you the authority to start another disastrous war in the Middle East just because the brutal Saudi dictatorship told you to."
"I said it in 1993 and I will say it again now: If you want a simpler, more cost-effective health care system, the way forward is a Medicare for All, single-payer program."
"200 days ago, Nancy Pelosi and her House colleagues passed expanded background checks, taking common-sense action to prevent another horrific mass shooting.

What has Mitch McConnell done? Nothing but the NRA's bidding.

Do your damn job, Senator."
"Here's the business model: 

‚Ä¢ Flood the country with painkillers
‚Ä¢ Lie about the addictive effects
‚Ä¢ Start opioid epidemic 
‚Ä¢ Cut a deal, admit no wrongdoing
‚Ä¢ Hide money in Swiss bank accounts

The billionaire Sackler family must be held criminally liable for their greed."
Wall Street billionaires have cooked up a new scheme: buying up health clinics so they can charge unsuspecting patients insane ‚Äúout-of-network‚Äù fees. That is pretty disgusting.
The Republicans who are suppressing the vote are terrified of how we could transform this country when millions more Americans are allowed to participate in our democracy. They are cowards.
"By stopping the U.S. support that Saudi Arabia needs to carry out its bombings in Yemen, we can help end the world‚Äôs worst humanitarian crisis.
 
I've passed an awful lot of amendments in Congress over the years, so let me tell you: this one is important."
"I've never met a voter, Republican or Democrat, who is begging the government to let corporations pollute the sources we rely on for drinking water even more.
 
Yet that's just what Trump is doing, threatening 117 million Americans. Big polluters are in charge of our government."
"Workers of all backgrounds are standing up for their rights. That includes yoga teachers, who are facing down shameful anti-union propaganda from their Wall Street owners. This is exactly the kind of energy we need to rebuild the middle class."
"It is unbelievable that this needs to be said: American citizens are not something to be ‚Äúcleaned up,‚Äù Mr. Trump.

I have a much better idea. Build homes for all 552,730 unsheltered people, at a cost of less than 10% of Trump‚Äôs tax cut for the rich and large corporations."
Now do AR-15s.
"Home health aides, mostly women of color, do enormous work caring for our elderly. Yet they are insanely overworked and get poverty pay. Almost half need public assistance. 

What they need are the living wages and benefits they are entitled to in America."
"Today, we remember the 3,000 Americans we lost on September 11, 2001, and we honor the bravery of the emergency workers who rushed into danger in order to save lives."
96 percent of Democrats and 83 percent of Republicans support background checks for all potential gun buyers. The gun lobby should not control Congress.
"This is what oligarchy looks like. If you're a member of the family that controls Cargill, you can award yourself a $5 million payout. 

Meanwhile, small farmers are struggling and Mitch McConnell is blocking a raise to $15 an hour for 40 million workers."
"Mr. Trump lied. He promised to strengthen health care‚Äîinstead, he has done everything he can to sabotage the Affordable Care Act.

The result: Nearly two million people joined the ranks of the uninsured last year, the first increase in the uninsured rate in a decade."
It's absurd that the United States is the only advanced country that does not guarantee its workers paid vacation time. A mom and a dad ought to have the right to at least a couple of weeks of paid vacation so they can spend quality time with their kids.
The DMV should not use its trove of personal information as a tool to make money. Nobody‚Äîfrom agencies like the DMV to large corporations like Facebook and Google‚Äîshould be profiting from sharing or selling personal information without meaningful consent.
This is dangerous. Too many Americans have fought and died to defend American democracy to let President Trump act like an authoritarian.
"Poverty is, in my view, a death sentence. The poorest older Americans die at twice the rate as the richest. 

We must end our country‚Äôs obscene inequality and ensure basic economic security for all‚Äîor we will condemn an entire generation to early death."
"If @realDonaldTrump was serious about ending U.S. wars in the Middle East, he would‚Äôve signed our bipartisan bill to stop the Yemen war instead of vetoing it.

If Congress does not stand up to him and defund it, the Saudi-led war could kill 233,000 Yemenis by the end of the year."
"The world's largest military budgets:

"Here are 6 of the 10 fastest-growing jobs in America:

‚Ä¢ Cook‚Äî$26,530
‚Ä¢ Waiter‚Äî$21,780
‚Ä¢ Janitor‚Äî$26,110

If we want a decent, humane society, workers must get at least $15 an hour and a union."
"Under a Medicare for All system, we are going to guarantee health care to all people as a human right. Working people should not have to search around for coupons or risk going into bankruptcy to afford their medical care."
"How absurd is it that Social Security has lifted 22 million Americans out of poverty and is among the most popular government programs in existence, but Republicans still want to cut it? Sorry, GOP, but our job is not to cut Social Security. Our job is to expand it."
"Mr. Trump wasted everyone's time with ludicrous talk about trying to buy Greenland.

Wouldn't it be nice if we had a leader who tried to stop it from melting?"
"Addiction is a disease, not criminal activity.

Here's who should be held criminally liable: The top executives of the opioid manufacturers who lied by pushing a product they knew was addictive on doctors and patients, causing a national public health emergency."
"Here's a fact you don't hear too often: Half of America‚Äôs workers make less than $19 an hour.
 
When we double the federal minimum wage from $7.25 to $15, we'll boost pay up the income ladder. That means workers making above $15 an hour‚Äî11.6 million of them‚Äîwill also get raises."
"The loan sharks of today wear expensive suits and work on Wall Street, where they make hundreds of millions of dollars by pushing sky-high fees and outrageous interest rates as high as 27 percent on American consumers. Together, we must end their greed."
"Trump's still trying to waste billions of taxpayer dollars on a wall, using a phony ""national emergency"" to ignore Congress and the Constitution.
 
Think of the urgent work we could be doing together, instead, if we treated climate change like the national emergency that it is."
"Just in time for the new school year, billionaire Betsy DeVos wants to make it harder for students who were the victims of fraud to get their debts cancelled. She has got to be the worst Secretary of Education in the modern history of our country."
"The fossil fuel industry is now the equivalent of the tobacco industry. It creates death and destruction, then spends billions denying its responsibility.
 
Let us be clear: Hurricane Dorian has everything to do with climate change, which is the existential crisis of our time."
Bipartisan majorities of Congress told Mr. Trump to end this unconstitutional war. Now we must use Congress‚Äôs power of the purse to block every nickel of taxpayer money from going to help the Saudi dictatorship as it bombs and starves civilians in Yemen.
"If you were born in 1973, the median wage went from $17 to $19 an hour over your lifetime. That‚Äôs it. Two bucks in 45 years. 

The top 1%'s annual income tripled: $480K to $1.45 million.

That's why we need a political revolution. To build an economy for all of us‚Äînot the 1%."
"Eight million people work two or more jobs just to survive in the world's richest country. Their stories show us an economy of, by, and for the 1%.

It's time to stand up, fight back, and build a society where America's working class can live in dignity."
"This Labor Day, I stand with my House colleagues. Mitch McConnell: You do not have the right to deprive the American people of a debate to give millions of workers a raise. Bring the Raise The Wage Act to the floor for a vote."
"U.S. bombs, logistical support, and intelligence for the Saudi dictatorship's airstrikes make us complicit in this nightmare.

Congress has declared this war unconstitutional. We must now stand up to Trump and defund all U.S. involvement in these horrors."
"Even the part of Trump‚Äôs tax scam supposedly for low-income neighborhoods is a massive tax avoidance scheme for the ultra-rich.
 
President Trump has many critics. But as a con artist, he is a talent of the highest caliber."
"Average cost of a year of college: $50,000
Median family income: $61,000

We let middle-class parents drown in debt trying to ensure a middle-class future for their kids. That is obscene.

We must cancel student debt and make public colleges tuition-free."
"It is unconscionable that this man was given a lifetime prison sentence and kept behind bars for 36 years‚Äîfor stealing $50 at the age of 22.

We have a racist criminal justice system that must be fundamentally transformed."
"How crazy is it that there was no in-state tuition for all students in California, until the 1970s? College was free.

Not crazy at all. Don't let anyone tell you that we cannot tax Wall Street to fund tuition-free college and the cancellation of student debt."
"Strong unions are the reason why America once led the world in wages in benefits. No wonder they're so popular, despite decades of right-wing attacks. We must rebuild the trade union movement in this country."
Good. Now let's do every other state and territory in the country.
"It is crazy that we are the only country that lets drug companies charge anything they want‚Äîeven $6 million‚Äîand raise the price tomorrow.

Taxpayers give Big Pharma patent monopolies, tax breaks and research money. But Medicare isn't allowed to negotiate fair prices. Shameful."
"The Amazon is being destroyed. So Trump opens America's largest rainforest, Tongass National Forest, to logging and mining. 

Methane emissions surge worldwide. Trump's EPA will make them grow faster.

The president and his billionaire friends are a threat to our entire planet."
"What does it mean when the function of the health care system‚Äîin the richest country in the history of the world‚Äîis to make billions for insurance and drug companies? 

18 percent of Americans with diabetes are rationing the medications they need to live."
"On Trump's watch, 3,000 Americans died after Hurricane Mar√≠a. A new storm approaches and 33,000 Puerto Ricans still live under blue tarps.
 
Trump's response? Divert $155 million from FEMA for migrant detention, complain about federal aid, and mock Puerto Rican officials. Insane."
"Due to the failure of the federal government, 33,000 roofs still have blue tarps almost two years after Hurricane Mar√≠a. We must commit full resources to prepare our fellow citizens for the worst and stand with them for as long as is necessary to finally help rebuild Puerto Rico."
"This fine is a step in the right direction. But I want to see the corporate executives at Johnson &amp; Johnson, Purdue, and other companies held criminally liable for their actions."
"Trump complains about ""bad"" trade negotiators. But U.S. negotiators under both parties deliberately pushed through trade deals written by huge corporations designed to outsource millions of U.S. jobs and exploit cheap labor. 

We need fair trade to protect workers and our planet."
People say climate action is expensive. But the price of inaction is far more costly. Intense heat waves could kill tens of thousands of Americans each year if we don't act. We must move urgently and boldly to transform our energy system.
"If its CEO @SteveEasterbrk gets paid $85 million over three years, @McDonalds can damn well pay all its workers at least $15 an hour. @McDonaldsCorp market value grew $71 billion while it paid the average cashier a starvation wage of $9 an hour. Shameful."
"Trains from Boston to D.C. take 7-8 hours. Trains from Beijing to Shanghai go nearly twice as far in half the time.
 
A Green New Deal means major public investments in American-made high-speed rail. We can lower emissions, create good union jobs, and improve our quality of life."
"Trump said he wanted to get us out of Middle East conflicts. He lied. When we passed a bill to end U.S. involvement in the Saudi-led war in Yemen, he vetoed it. 

Congress must now defund all U.S. support for this war. Millions of lives are at stake."
"Over 40 years, income per person doubled. But half our people live paycheck to paycheck. Why?

Because the top 1% captured 45% of new income. And the median hourly wage grew by $2 over 40 years.

This is a rigged economy. And the working class needs to come together to fix it."
Let's be clear: Trickle-down economics is nothing but a fraudulent theory designed by the rich and their think tanks to protect billionaires and large corporations.
"The banks are still at it. This is the very same Wall Street recklessness that led to economic disaster and ruined millions of lives across our country. Unless we end their greed, American taxpayers will be on the hook again."
"Black women make 61 cents on the dollar compared to white men, and their wages continue to fall further and further behind. That is simply a disgrace.

We should guarantee equal pay for equal work. This is not a radical idea‚Äîthis is an issue of basic justice."
"It will take student borrowers 100 years to repay their debt for the ""crime"" of getting a higher education. That is insane.

We have got to hit the reset button. We should cancel all student debt in this country and make Wall Street pay for it."
"For centuries, America‚Äôs rise relied on treating Black people as literal property. ""Slavery By Another Name"" continued well into the 20th century. I believe we should talk about this part of our history, and learn about how it has shaped every aspect of our politics and economy."
"If the richest Americans do not start paying their fair share of taxes, we are headed for a future where they control all of the wealth and the rest of the country has none. All of it.

To me, that is outrageous and that is not what America is about."
"On many issues, we are divided, but comprehensive background checks are supported by 97 percent of Americans. President Trump is a coward whose failure to act threatens public safety."
"The business model of Wells Fargo is fraud. Yet how many people at Wells Fargo are going to jail? Zero.

But if you smoke marijuana in this country, you get a criminal record. That is unacceptable."
"We still can't import medicine from Canada at a fraction of the price. My bill, the Affordable and Safe Prescription Drug Importation Act, ends this absurdity. We can lower drug prices and save lives. 

Does @realDonaldTrump have the guts to stand up to Big Pharma‚Äôs greed?"
"CEOs of billion-dollar companies say they want to invest in their workers and communities. Good. I have a few ideas for them:

‚úÖ Provide a living wage of at least $15 an hour
‚úÖ Stop union-busting and outsourcing jobs
‚úÖ Pay your taxes, don't evade them"
"Trump and the Republicans' latest attack on women's rights is this gag rule on health providers. Their goal is to overturn Roe v. Wade.

We will not let them win. We must fight together until a woman‚Äôs constitutional right to abortion is truly secure."
"Together, we will cancel all student debt. And we're going to make Wall Street speculators pay for every nickel of it."
"Whether America's climate-action plan is 1,000 pages long or two pages long, at the end of the day, we all know what it‚Äôs about. It‚Äôs about building the political power to tell the fossil fuel industry: Sorry, you cannot continue to destroy the planet for short-term profits."
"Billionaires and huge corporations should not be allowed to use loopholes and tax havens to avoid paying their fair share. At a time of massive global inequality the very wealthy should be paying more in taxes, not less."
"Some say we can't afford tuition-free public college. 

Let me get this straight: 40 years ago, in an economy with half the income per person, some of the best public schools were essentially free. 

But guaranteeing college for all is so ""radical"" that we can't afford it today?"
"President Trump proposed cutting Social Security benefits by $25 billion in his budget. That should outrage all of us, young and old alike. 

No, Mr. President, we will not let you cut Social Security. We will fight to expand it."
"Think of how crazy you have to be, in the middle of a mass-extinction event, to try to destroy the Endangered Species Act.

I‚Äôm sure Trump‚Äôs friends in the fossil fuel and mineral industries are happy with his attack on our biodiversity."
"Over 40 years:

‚Ä¢ GDP per person doubled
‚Ä¢ CEO pay ‚¨ÜÔ∏è 1,000%
‚Ä¢ CEOs, who got $30 for every $1 a worker made, now get $278
‚Ä¢ The median wage grew $2 an hour since 1978

A political revolution means standing up to billionaires to say: Enough is enough. You can't have it all."
"If Prime Minister @Netanyahu doesn't want members of Congress to visit Israel, then maybe he can respectfully decline $3.8 billion in annual funding‚Äîthe largest amount of U.S. aid to any country.

I believe in an even-handed approach to ending the Israeli-Palestinian conflict."
"It's confirmed: July was the hottest month ever recorded. 

How insane is it that our Environmental Protection Agency is now run by a former coal lobbyist? We must stand up to the fossil fuel industry and say: you will no longer dictate our climate policy."
"No senior should have to sell their belongings or spend their life savings just to be able to age in place. 

Under the Medicare for All, long-term, home-based care will be guaranteed as a right to every senior and person with a disability in America."
"Banning Congresswomen Omar and Tlaib from entering Israel and Palestine is a sign of enormous disrespect to these elected leaders, to the United States Congress, and to the principles of democracy. The Israeli government should reverse this decision and allow them in."
"When @RepCummings and I asked pharma CEOs about soaring drug prices, they coordinated to block our investigation.

@MylanNews and @TevaUSA: Obstructing our inquiry is a crime. The American people deserve answers about your price-fixing conspiracy."
Mr. Trump is a lying bigot.
"On this day, 84 years ago, FDR signed Social Security into law. It is one of the most successful programs in our country‚Äôs history and lifts more Americans out of poverty than any other.
 
We are not going to cut Social Security‚Äîwe are going to expand it."
"The effects of climate change already affect all of us‚Äîrural and urban residents, inland and coastal communities alike.

Let's come together as a nation and mobilize a response as large and serious as the emergency itself. Our future depends on it."
"Do you think it‚Äôs a coincidence that the racist manifesto of the El Paso shooter echoes Trump‚Äôs language of ‚Äúinvasion‚Äù and ‚Äúinfestation‚Äù of immigrants? I don‚Äôt. 

@realDonaldTrump is fanning the flames of white supremacy. We must stop him."
The United States needs to end the international embarrassment of being the only industrialized nation not to provide paid family leave.
"We must not be about tearing small children away from their families. In 2002, I voted against creation of DHS and the establishment of ICE. That was the right vote. 

What our cruel and broken immigration system needs is comprehensive reform."
"$70,000 a minute. 
$4 million per hour. 
$100 million per day. 

That's how much the Walton family, the richest family in the world, made last year. 

I say to the Walton family: No more excuses. Pay your workers a living wage‚Äîat least $15 an hour."
"I guess this is what Senator Mitch McConnell calls ""leadership"": Defending starvation wages for American workers, inaction on the climate crisis, and doing nothing to stop mass shootings."
"Health care is a right, not a privilege. We need Medicare for All so we can end the disgrace of 30 million Americans having no health insurance, and many more being underinsured with high deductibles and co-payments."
"Our grassroots movement got Democrats and Republicans to pass our bill to end the U.S. role in Saudi Arabia's brutal war in Yemen. 

Although Trump vetoed it, Congress can still rein in this president and put an end to the world's worst humanitarian crisis."
"Billionaire Wall Street investors think they‚Äôre pretty savvy. But their big bet on fossil fuels didn‚Äôt pan out: BlackRock lost $90 billion investing in oil and coal over 10 years. 

Maybe after a few billion more in losses, they‚Äôll realize we should act to solve climate change."
"Prescription drug costs are too damn high!

For decades, we've been paying more to pharmaceutical companies than any other country. You know what that makes us? The suckers of the world."
"In 1923, researchers who discovered insulin sold the patent for $1 so it would be available to all. But drug companies hijacked this lifesaving medicine and now charge over $300 a vial.
 
Let‚Äôs be clear about this: Big Pharma‚Äôs greed is literally killing people in this country."
"Billions around the world are at risk of drought, displacement, and resource wars. 

What if, instead of spending $738 billion a year on the Pentagon and weapons systems, the United States brought the world together to cooperate on solving climate change?"
We should cancel it.
"July 2019 was the hottest month in recorded history. Make no mistake: this is an emergency. 

We cannot afford to simply wait Trump out. Congress must act boldly to tackle the climate threat‚Äîthe fate of our children and grandchildren depend on it."
"Why are we the only advanced country with no guaranteed family leave, sick days or vacations? Because corporate America hates unions.
 
Our plan, the Workplace Democracy Act, will revitalize union organizing so America's working class has a dignified life."
"President Trump faces a choice: bring the country together to pass commonsense gun safety measures‚Äîor blame the internet. He has decided to side with the NRA, whose lobbyists and campaign contributions control the Republican party. 
#VideogamesAreNotToBlame"
"On the issue of guns, we are not so divided: Over 90% of the public supports universal background checks. 
 
@SenateGOP and @realDonaldTrump: the country is demanding action right now. Will you side with the American people or will you just do what the @NRA wants?"
"No one should profit from imprisoning people, especially children.

We must end this morally repugnant business."
"A society which proclaims freedom as its goal, as the United States does, must work unceasingly to end the disgraceful bigotry and violence against transgender Americans."
"The Puerto Rican people came together, stood up, and forced Governor Rossell√≥ to resign. They showed us what ordinary people can achieve when we organize. Our job now is to make sure they get fair and responsive representation. Puerto Rico deserves democracy, not austerity."
"I say to Mitch McConnell: Do not ignore the will of 200 million Americans who want us to put an end to starvation wages in the United States.

Let the American people have a vote on a $15 minimum wage!"
"The pharmaceutical industry will claim the outrageous prices they charge for life-saving medicines are necessary.

Maybe they haven‚Äôt heard of a country that we share thousands of miles of a border with, where they sell the exact same drugs for a fraction of the price."
"For far too long, the U.S. government has failed the people of Puerto Rico. That must end today. President Trump must act now to ensure that the federal government is doing everything in its power to fully rebuild Puerto Rico."
"The Pentagon is set to grow by $90 billion and reach $738 billion next year. For $90 billion, we could double nutrition assistance or provide $7,000 to every child in poverty. 

We cannot keep handing over billions to the military-industrial complex."
"We should pay attention to this: Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, a far-right authoritarian, is rapidly destroying the Amazon rainforest. He is a threat to working people, minorities, journalists, and a habitable planet. No wonder Trump loves him so much."
"If every major country on the planet can guarantee health care to all and achieve better health outcomes, while spending less per capita, please do not tell us that the United States of America cannot do the same."
"This is what an energy transition looks like when we have no plan. The coal company Blackjewel has filed for bankruptcy‚Äîmeanwhile, its miners have not been paid for weeks. 

We need to move to a sustainable economy with a just and fair transition for workers and their families."
"To restore our one-person-one-vote democracy, we must pass a constitutional amendment to overturn Citizens United and stop this country's slide to oligarchy."
"It makes no sense for young people to be denied jobs because they were arrested for smoking marijuana. It is time to decriminalize marijuana, expunge past marijuana convictions and end the failed war on drugs."
"The Saudis said Jamal Khashoggi‚Äôs murder was a ‚Äòrogue operation.‚Äô That was a lie. 

A new piece reveals the regime‚Äôs ongoing efforts to harass and kidnap its critics around the world. It's past time to rethink our relationship with this repressive regime."
"I wonder why Donald Trump vetoed our historic legislation to end U.S. involvement in the brutal bombing of Yemen. Who benefits from that?

Raytheon, Boeing, Lockheed Martin, and General Dynamics: the four corporations making 90 percent of the weapons that we sell to Saudi Arabia."
"It is unacceptable that across every chronic and acute health condition, people of color fare worse than their white counterparts. Together, we can fight racial bias and repair our broken health care system by passing the Health Equity and Accountability Act and Medicare for All."
"Let us be clear: In states where they have increased the minimum wage, paychecks are higher and the economy is booming. There is no excuse not to raise the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour and end starvation wages for 40 million Americans."
"Public support for Medicare for All is rising. Why? The reason is pretty obvious. It is getting harder and harder to defend a dysfunctional health care system in which 30,000 people die every year because they don't get to a doctor when they should."
"How crazy is this? Even though car makers agreed with California to keep stronger fuel efficiency standards, the EPA is proposing to allow more tailpipe pollution. Trump's loyalty to the fossil fuel industry is threatening the very lives of our children."
"The climate crisis means more frequent and more intense heatwaves around the world. Our job must be to rapidly transform our energy system from fossil fuels to energy efficiency and sustainable energy. With a Green New Deal, we can save the planet and create millions of new jobs."
"I agree with @Ilhan. We must counter Trump's racist playbook by advancing policies that unmistakably improve working people‚Äôs lives, like strengthening collective bargaining, raising the minimum wage, and treating jobs and health care as human rights."
"For three decades, I have been advocating for tuition-free college. If you are new to this effort, we welcome you to the fight for justice."
".@RepRaulGrijalva is right. We must stand with the people of Puerto Rico in this decisive moment, and make sure their will is not trampled upon by an unelected board making cuts to education and health care."
"Our broken criminal justice system targets poor people and minorities disproportionately with the death penalty, including those who are innocent. The government should not be in the business of killing people. We must abolish capital punishment."
"Nobody should be ""drowning,"" worrying about becoming homeless, because of crushing student debt in the United States of America.

It is time to tax Wall Street to fund student debt cancellation and tuition-free public colleges for all."
"The president‚Äôs veto enables the sale of $8.1 billion in weapons sales to Saudi Arabia's brutal dictators. It will deepen and prolong the world's worst humanitarian crisis in Yemen. It infringes on Congress' authority over matters of war.

What a disgrace."
"Why is it that year after year, our people are living shorter lives while we spend more and more on health care?

Pharmaceutical profits are a big part of the story. 

If we want to solve the opioid crisis, their greed and criminality must come to an end."
Trump is a scam artist and a demagogue. He is using racism to divide working people and distract from his loyalty to billionaires and huge corporations. It won't work. The American people will come together and defeat this strategy of fomenting hate.
"Trump proposed $87 billion in cuts to infrastructure over the next 10 years in his budget. How is it, Mr. President, that a nation can thrive when its infrastructure is crumbling?"
"This proposal belongs in the trash, @realDonaldTrump. No one should go hungry in the United States of America."
"If we could bail out Wall Street and give $1.5 trillion in tax breaks to private corporations, we damn well can cancel all student debt in this country‚Äîno exceptions."
"Teachers are facing outrageous levels of student debt. It is time to cancel student debt for all and make public universities and colleges tuition-free. @Ilhan, @RepJayapal and I are incredibly proud to have the support of @rweingarten and @AFTUnion in this effort. #CollegeforAll"
"Hundreds of thousands of people in Puerto Rico are demonstrating against corruption, Wall Street-imposed austerity, and decades of economic devastation. We stand with them: Governor Rossello must resign. Puerto Rico needs new leadership and a new direction."
"Big Pharma lied about opioid addictiveness. And here they are, joking about their racket in these emails. Their greed has no limits. We must pass the Opioid Crisis Accountability Act to hold top executives criminally liable for the devastation they caused."
"Does Donald Trump want a war with Iran? Who knows? Nobody in the world knows what they'll do tomorrow. And given the confusion in this administration, it‚Äôs possible they may. 

But this I do know: The United States Congress must do everything it can to prevent this war."
"I stand with the people of Puerto Rico, who have taken to the streets for a national strike, to demand the immediate resignation of Governor Rossell√≥. We must ensure the full support of the federal government in the rebuilding and recovery of Puerto Rico."
"Bank of America, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo have all seen their tax rates go from 30 to 22 percent thanks to Trump's tax scam.  

Our job: repeal it and tax Wall Street to cancel $1.6 trillion in student debt."
"How is it that in the richest country in the history of the world, we can't afford to pay everyone a living wage? Until we raise the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour, I'm going to keep asking."
"You want good, clean teeth? Simple: Brush your teeth, floss, and fight for Medicare for All."
The window for meaningful climate action is closing. Our job: come together to take on the powerful fossil fuel industry and mobilize a national response as large and serious as the emergency itself. Our future depends on it.
"‚ö†Ô∏èThe past 5 years are the hottest on record
‚ö†Ô∏èThis June is the hottest June recorded
‚ö†Ô∏èThousands die in heatwaves around the world

Trump's ignorance is threatening the lives of our children. For their sake, we must stand up to the fossil fuel industry and build a green economy."
"Mitch McConnell is wrong. Since 1979, when a state has increased the min. wage, employment and wages typically go up, not down. A $15 minimum wage would raise wages for 39 million people and lift millions of Americans out of poverty. Why is McConnell afraid to let us vote on it?"
"I stand with the people of Puerto Rico taking to the streets to demand accountability for the governor and an end to corruption.

After dealing with hurricanes and a decade of austerity, Puerto Ricans have a right to democracy and full federal support to get out of this crisis."
"Four years ago, @KeithEllison and I rallied with low wage workers for an increase in the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour.

We were laughed at. We were told it was unrealistic. We were told it wouldn't happen. 

Not anymore."
"After supporting a huge increase in military spending for the most dangerous president in American history, it would be outrageous for the House to approve a bill that would deny primary care to over 3 million Americans by cutting community health centers by 20% in real dollars."
"Remember when $15 an hour was ""radical""? Not so radical anymore thanks to people fighting for a living wage. In a historic vote today, the House of Representatives will pass legislation to end poverty wages for 33 million people."
"#IStandWithIlhan and am proud to work with her in Congress. 

Trump is stoking the most despicable and disturbing currents in our society. And that very hatred and racism fuels him. We must fight together to defeat the most dangerous president in the history of our country."
"Exactly 50 years after the moon landing, we can again mobilize as a nation to overcome enormous challenges. We have no time to waste in taking on climate change, which is a true national emergency. Here's how @repblumenauer and I plan to tackle it:"
"I congratulate my friend @SenatorLeahy for casting his 16,000th vote in the U.S. Senate! Senator Leahy has worked tirelessly for the people of Vermont since 1974, bringing our state's values of justice and openness to Washington. I look forward to continuing our work together."
"""A democracy cannot function effectively when its constituent members believe laws are being bought and sold."" This was Justice John Paul Stevens‚Äô prophetic dissent against Citizens United. During his tenure on the Supreme Court, he was astute and fair. We will miss him."
"One might have thought given all the Republicans in the House and Senate, a vast number would be standing up and saying the president's racist comments do not reflect the views of their party. It is sad and disappointing the degree to which Trump's ideology has dominated the GOP."
"I am not interested in a photo op at an Amazon warehouse. I am calling for Labor Department inspectors to come in, unannounced, and do thorough investigations of the facilities where hundreds of workers have told me about horrendous conditions and abuse."
"The grassroots of our country came together and got the Congress to pass a bipartisan prohibition on unconstitutional war with Iran. Given the recklessness of this administration, I intend to do everything I can in the Senate to get this passed. No war with Iran!"
"Amazon #PrimeDay sales are nice, but not if they come at the expense of worker safety. The Department of Labor must #InvestigateAmazon."
"I believe, with @IlhanMN and my colleagues, that a complete investigation by @OSHA_DOL into Amazon warehouses is long overdue. The reports of dangerous, dehumanizing conditions‚Äîwhere 125,000 Americans are working for the wealthiest man in the history of the world‚Äîare sickening."
Climate change is an existential disaster facing the entire world. We should start acting like it.
I stand in solidarity with the courageous Amazon workers engaging in a work stoppage against unconscionable working conditions in their warehouses. It is not too much to ask that a company owned by the wealthiest person in the world treat its workers with dignity and respect.
"This is how we defeat Donald Trump's disgraceful bigotry and xenophobia. When billionaires use racism to divide us, we build solidarity among working people‚Äîimmigrants and non-immigrants, gay and straight, men and women, black and brown and white."
"The American people are sick and tired of a president who is a liar, a fraud, a narcissist and a bully, @realDonaldTrump. They want leadership which unites us, not divides us."
"We must oppose Mr. Trump's nightmarish mass-deportation plans. We must stop family separation, reunite families that have been separated, and eliminate private detention facilities. Know your rights. Conozca sus derechos."
The time is long overdue for comprehensive and humane reform of our immigration system. These members of Congress went to the Southern border to go inside detention facilities operated by the Trump administration. What they saw horrified them.
Appalachians deal with dirty air and water because of the coal industry's greed. They are standing up and fighting back. @NRDems and I are committed to working with these communities to build just and healthy local economies as we tackle the climate crisis.
"Throughout our history, the Postal Service and its unions have been vital institutions providing a pathway into the middle class for working families, particularly communities of color. I stand with @mrdannyglover: we will not allow @USPS to be privatized."
"Alex Acosta should never have been nominated as Labor Secretary. Now is the time to put an end to our two-tiered criminal justice system. We need a Labor Secretary who puts workers first, not billionaires‚Äîand certainly not billionaire sexual predators of underage girls."
Donald Trump doesn‚Äôt give a damn about the working people of America. His singular aim is to help his billionaire friends make as much money as possible. We need to take on the pharmaceutical industry whose greed is killing Americans and lower the price of medicine in half.
"I applaud the House of Representatives for voting to end all U.S. participation in the disastrous Saudi-led war in Yemen. Congress has the power to end this brutal, unconstitutional military intervention. I will do everything in my power in the Senate to see that it becomes law."
"Congratulations to the University of Texas for expanding access to tuition-free college! This is a step in the right direction. 

Our plan: tax Wall Street, raise $2.4 trillion, cancel student debt, and eliminate tuition at every public college and university for all students."
"You can call me a lot of things but you cannot call me inconsistent. Our country must join every other major nation of the world and guarantee health care as a human right. 

I hope we are not going to keep debating this for another 50 years. #MedicareforAll"
"I agree with Senator Cruz. Congress already blocked weapons sales to the authoritarian regime of Saudi Arabia. 

Mr. President: follow the damn law."
"These incredible high schoolers are working to stop the unconstitutional U.S.-Saudi war in Yemen. They know Congress has the power of the purse. A new effort by @RepRoKhanna, @RepAdamSchiff, @RepAdamSmith and @RepJayapal will defund Trump's participation in this brutal conflict."
"Climate disasters that can cause death, displacement and suffering‚Äîunprecedented heatwaves, storms, and flooding‚Äînow occur at a rate of one per week.
 
If that is not an emergency, I don't know what is."
Happy #CowAppreciationDay.
Republicans are still trying to eliminate the Affordable Care Act. They couldn't do it through Congress because the American people rose up. Now they are going through the courts. Our job: keep up the pressure and stop them from kicking millions of people off their health care.
"After the Pearl Harbor attacks, America came together and in three years mobilized for victory in World War II. 

Today, Congress must lead a national mobilization to take on the fossil fuel industry, transform our economy, and defeat a climate emergency."
"Ross Perot was a champion for veterans' rights and ahead of his time on disastrous trade policies. During his campaign, he explained, in depth, how he would address our national problems and spurred serious discussion. Ross Perot was a one-of-a kind American. He will be missed."
"I am proud to stand with @AOC and @repblumenauer today to announce our resolution declaring a climate emergency. 

If Trump insists on denying the reality of climate change, Congress must act to mobilize America and defeat this existential threat."
"Every time a minimum wage increase has been proposed, the extreme right wing and their billionaire campaign contributors claim that jobs will be destroyed. 

They have been proven dead wrong. It is time to raise the minimum wage to at least $15 an hour."
"President Trump‚Äôs record on the environment is pathetic and an embarrassment to the world. This is a man who still thinks climate change is a ""hoax."" He better start listening to scientists and not his friends in the fossil fuel, chemical, and big agribusiness industries."
"In the richest country in the history of the world, no one should be living in poverty. It‚Äôs time to raise the current starvation level minimum wage to a living wage. It's time for Congress to pass the Raise the Wage Act to increase the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour."
"Millions of people are raising money on GoFundMe right now to fund their health care and life-saving medication. To my mind, that is not a functioning health care system. We must pass Medicare for All."
Let‚Äôs cancel $1.6 trillion in student debt and make public universities tuition-free instead.
"It was 115 degrees Fahrenheit in France last week ‚Äì the highest temperature they have ever recorded.
 
Still think climate change is a hoax, @realDonaldTrump? You are delusional."
Wishing you and your loved ones a very safe and happy 4th of July.
"I‚Äôm sure this will come as a big surprise to you: Trump‚Äôs phony rhetoric did nothing to stop skyrocketing drug prices.
 
We need a president who will stand up to the greed of Big Pharma instead of appointing a pharma CEO to ""oversee"" that very industry."
"This is what authoritarians do: @realDonaldTrump is taking $2.5 million away from our National Park Service to glorify himself with a spectacle of military tanks rolling through Washington. And top GOP donors are getting VIP seats, all at taxpayer expense."
"Racist and sexist behavior on the part of those who wear a uniform of the United States is completely unacceptable.

@DHSgov must investigate and take strong action against those found guilty of this vulgar behavior."
"Make no mistake: this is a major victory for democracy and a defeat for the xenophobic Trump Administration. The Census is supposed to count everyone, including immigrants. When we stand together and fight back, we can defeat Trump's bigotry."
"Over the last decade, workers‚Äô wages barely kept up with inflation, while the number of billionaires in the United States more than doubled. The top 1% owns more wealth now than before the 2008 financial crash. 

This is what a rigged economy looks like:"
Racist and sexist behavior on the part of those who wear a uniform of the United States is unacceptable. The DHS must investigate and take strong action against those found guilty of this vulgar behavior.
"This is the point of canceling student debt and providing free college for all. Education should be treated as a public right, enjoyed by everyone‚Äînot a luxury afforded to the few."
"Trump promised he would stop big drug companies from ""getting away with murder."" He lied.

My bill with @RepRoKhanna stops Big Pharma's greed by cutting prescription drug prices in half so that Americans no longer pay the highest prices in the world."
"I have no problem with Trump negotiating with Kim Jong Un. But while he's meeting with Kim, he's pushed us to the brink of war with Iran, and kept us in the horrific Saudi-led war in Yemen. 

We can't just have photo opportunities. We need real diplomacy."
"Today, we mourn the loss of Luis Alvarez, a champion for the health of 9/11 first responders, and one of the selfless men and women who searched for survivors at Ground Zero. 

We must build a society where we take care of each other and treat heath care as a human right."
"Fifty years after the Stonewall Uprising, let us reflect on how the struggle for justice, dignity and equality is advanced. #Stonewall50"
"Today, I stood with a majority of my Senate colleagues who voted to uphold the rule of law. The Constitution and the War Powers Act are perfectly clear: President Trump cannot go to war with Iran without congressional authorization."
"I am proud that @NEAToday, which represents 3 million educators, supports our College for All Act. Canceling student debt lets more people to follow their passion to teach in public school. And tuition-free college and trade school ensures education as a right, not a privilege."
I thank these 100 scholars for supporting our College For All Act. Young people face lower living standards than their parents enjoyed. We must act boldly and decisively to wipe out student debt and make education a right‚Äîand Wall Street will pay for it.
"You've got questions‚Äî@RepJayapal, @Ilhan and I have got answers. How do we cancel $1.6 trillion in student debt? We pay for it in a very simple way: a small tax on Wall Street speculation. This is not a ""radical"" idea."
"Are you a student or recent graduate? Apply for a paid internship in Senator Sanders' Burlington and Washington, D.C. offices by June 30."
"These deaths are what a broken immigration system is all about. Instead of demonizing immigrants, Trump should be meeting with Central American leaders to find ways to end the horrific violence and poverty that are forcing people to flee their homelands."
"As a child, @RepJimmyGomez grew up without health insurance. Today he is calling for Medicare for All to guarantee health care to every person, so that no one has to go through what his family did."
"El Congreso asign√≥ fondos para asistencia nutricional de emergencia hace semanas. Mientras los puertorrique√±os pasan hambre, @USDA, @SecretarySonny, @OMBPress, y @MickMulvaneyOMB mantienen esta ayuda en el limbo burocr√°tico. ¬°La administraci√≥n debe proveer estos fondos ahora!"
"""I know smart, talented, debt-laden millennials who graduated into a post-Great Recession job market so mean and miserly that it literally had them eating out of Dumpsters."" #CancelStudentDebt"
"I don't often use this phrase, but today, we offered a truly revolutionary proposal to transform and improve our country in many ways. 

All of our people regardless of income deserve the education they need. #CollegeForAll #CancelStudentDebt"
"I believe in universality. That means if Trump wants to send his grandchildren to public school, he has that right. Wealthy kids go to public school right now. At the same time, we will make Wall Street, the top 1% and large corporations start paying their fair share of taxes."
"I agree with Harvard Business School professor Marco Di Maggio. Lifting the burden of student loans allows people to make better decisions, feel more freedom to make changes in their careers, and spend more money, which goes back into the economy."
"Thank you to @RepJayapal and @Ilhan for your bold leadership as co-sponsors of college for all and debt cancellation in the U.S. House.

To tax Wall Street and stop the student debt crisis, we need a movement. Working together, we will #CancelStudentDebt for 45 million Americans."
"Congress passed emergency nutrition assistance for Puerto Rico weeks ago. While Puerto Ricans are going hungry, @USDA, @SecretarySonny, @OMBPress, and @MickMulvaneyOMB are holding the funds in red tape limbo. The administration should immediately release these funds."
"Student debt disproportionately impacts African Americans and Latinos. 12 years after starting college, the median Black borrower owes more than he or she has taken out in the first place. 

Canceling student debt is an act of racial and economic justice."
"My colleagues @RepJayapal and @Ilhan are joining me to answer your questions on how we will #CancelStudentDebt. 

How does it work? How is it paid for? This is a crisis that we can solve if we have the political will. Watch live:"
I am going to make a prediction. The major opponents of our legislation to cancel $1.6 trillion in student debt‚Äîmark my words‚Äîwill be the exact same people who said we had to bail out Wall Street to the tune of billions upon billions of dollars.
"During the financial crisis, Wall Street received the largest taxpayer bailout in American history. Now it is Wall Street‚Äôs turn to help rebuild the disappearing middle class. #CancelStudentDebt"
"The United States once led the world in the percentage of young college graduates. Today, we are in 11th place, one in every four Americans has student debt, and 40 percent of all borrowers are expected to default by 2023. #CancelStudentDebt"
This school teacher is one of many millions of Americans who is being crushed by insurmountable student debt. More than 1 million people default on their student loans each year. We have got to make public colleges and universities tuition-free.
"Wealthy TV ""experts"" are shaming millennials for buying coffee and avocado toast. But young people are broke because they‚Äôre drowning in debt and low wages.
 
The ruling class wants to divide the young and old to distract us from an economy that‚Äôs rigged for the richest 1%."
"Nearly half of all college students are going hungry and the average college senior takes on $30,000 in debt.
 
But let's go beyond statistics. Share your personal story in a video or tweet, with the hashtag #CollegeForAll. And tell me what we should be doing to fix this crisis."
"If ICE agents show up at your door, know your rights.
Si agentes del ICE llegan a tu puerta, conoce tus derechos."
Let us not kid ourselves. It is very easy for politicians like Trump to pound the table and talk about how tough they are. But it will not be the sons and daughters of billionaires who get killed in a war with Iran. It will be the working class kids of this country.
A war with Iran would be a disaster and lead to endless conflict in the region. Congress must assert its constitutional authority and stop Trump from going to war.
"The president must respect the will of the majority of the Senate, which voted today to block weapons from being transferred to the brutal Saudi dictatorship. The Saudis are using U.S.-made bombs to kill people in Yemen and creating a horrific humanitarian disaster."
"The insurance industry is mounting a multi-million dollar campaign against Medicare for All. They want you to believe that the Canadian health care system that guarantees health care to every man, woman and child in that country is a disaster.

They are dead wrong."
Congratulations to the advocates who fought to pass this landmark bill to radically cut New York State‚Äôs carbon pollution and transform its energy system. This is a step in the right direction toward the type of bold action on climate change that we need.
"This president is going to have to learn that he is not a dictator, that there is a Constitution and a separation of powers in this country."
"If you think the invasion of Iraq was a disaster, a war with Iran would be worse. The United States must bring Iran and Saudi Arabia to the negotiating table, not foment a never-ending, unconstitutional war in the region."
"This is outrageous. President Trump‚Äôs proposal to repeal the Clean Power Plan is a stark reminder that instead of worrying about the future of our planet, he is more concerned with protecting the interests of his friends in the fossil fuel industry."
"The only thing Medicaid work requirements are good at is kicking people off their coverage. 

If the GOP wants to help people find work, they should invest in employment programs and guarantee health care as a right‚Äînot punish people who are struggling."
Representative Jayapal is exactly right. There is no such thing as a limited nuclear war. The $13 billion cost of this nuclear weapon would be much better spent fighting poverty and rebuilding the middle class. Thank you for standing up to the military industrial complex.
"A new United Nations report confirms what the CIA said: Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman ordered the murder of Jamal Khashoggi. It is time for the United States to reevaluate our relationship with this brutal regime, including ending support for the catastrophic Yemen war."
I'm proud to celebrate #Juneteenth with @MrDannyGlover. This year's holiday takes on special significance because of today's House hearing on H.R. 40 to study the impacts of slavery. We must come to terms with slavery's horrors and how they affect every aspect of our lives today.
The president won't address our health care crisis or climate change. But he will try to divide us up and go after undocumented people who have very little political power. That is what demagogues always do and that is why he must be defeated.
"Mr. President: Respect the Constitution. You have no legal authority to launch an attack on Iran. Come to Congress, present your evidence, and make your case. If not, we will assert our power under the War Powers Act to stop you."
"Itta Bena, Mississippi is a ""banking desert"" where residents are without basic banking services. This is why @AOC and I are calling for the return of postal banking in the United States. The big banks of this country are preying on poor people or ignoring them completely."
"It‚Äôs a national disgrace that a minimum wage worker cannot afford a modest one-bedroom apartment in 99% of counties in America. All Americans have a right to a decent, affordable home."
"Hoping for a full recovery for Red Sox great David ""Big Papi"" Ortiz, one of the most outstanding and popular baseball players in recent memory."
"Blackrock's role in destroying our planet is unacceptable. Our future is not in fossil fuel investments. Our future is shifting to sustainable energy, creating millions of jobs, leading the world in new technology and leaving our children a clean environment."
"‚ÄúIt‚Äôs demeaning. It‚Äôs demoralizing. It‚Äôs unjust.‚Äù That's what a rigged political system looks like. As a House member in 1999, I led a trip to Canada to buy cheaper drugs. Twenty years later, people are still organizing 'caravans' to buy insulin they need."
"While CEO pay has exploded, the minimum wage has lost more than 15 percent of its value since the last time it was raised. This is a starvation wage for 40 million people and everyone knows it. 

Congress must stand with the working people of this country. #RaisetheWage"
"This is not right: When it comes to who can afford to pay off their college debt and move on with their lives, there is a significant racial gap.
 
Our job is to make public colleges tuition-free and substantially reduce student debt in this country."
"The Gulf of Oman incident must not be used as a pretext for war with Iran. War would be an unmitigated disaster for the United States, Iran, the region, and the world. A unilateral U.S. attack on Iran would be illegal and unconstitutional."
America‚Äôs economic rise relied on treating Black people as literal property. We have not come to terms with the horrors of slavery and its continued impacts on our society. I am proud to cosponsor this bill to study and develop reparations proposals.
"Climate change is one of the greatest threats to global security. As we see more drought, as poor people are not able to grow the food they need, there will be migrations of millions of people all over the world. That is why we need a Green New Deal."
"""I do not begrudge any pregnant person‚Äôs personal choice, whatever it is. That is, in fact, the whole point.""

I hope Americans who do not believe in abortion will consider this powerful op-ed by @RepJayapal. Abortion must remain a constitutional right."
It is sick and disgraceful that pharmaceutical executives conspired to cover up their greedy price-fixing scheme when @RepCummings and I launched an investigation. They need to be investigated and held accountable by our criminal justice system.
"Donald Trump may not like it, but we are not an authoritarian country. The OSC recommendation is very clear: Ms. Conway must be removed from the federal government for violating the law."
"Can you believe it? Amazon is issuing credit cards with 28% interest rates to ""help"" people with bad credit. This kind of greed makes the poor even poorer and @AOC and I intend to outlaw it. Corporations will have to survive on a 15% cap on interest rates."
"Three years ago, 49 people lost their lives in the Pulse nightclub shooting. It is absurd that we have not passed common sense gun safety legislation by now‚Äîall because the GOP is in the pocket of the NRA. My thoughts are with those who are remembering their loved ones today."
"Today is historic! The powerful House @WaysMeansCmte is holding a hearing on universal health care ‚Äîa major step toward passing #MedicareforAll.

Watch @RepJayapal and @RepDebDingell explain what this hearing means, and how we advance the fight for health care as a human right."
"The internment of Japanese Americans is a stain on our history. It abhorrent that 75 years later, this administration now wants to hold migrant children in one of those same camps. 

We will look back on Trump‚Äôs racist child prisons as an abomination."
"El pueblo boricua sigue enfrent√°ndose a una crisis y merece recibir todos los fondos federales para la atenci√≥n de salud basada en la necesidad. Ya lleg√≥ la hora de que EE.UU trate a la gente de Puerto Rico como ciudadanos, no como sujetos coloniales."
"I'm proud of my home state of Vermont for reaffirming the right to abortion, at a time when Roe v. Wade is under attack by right-wing extremists across the country.
 
We cannot go back to the days when women did not have the right to control their own bodies."
Very glad to do so. Health care is a human right.
The Trump administration should start paying attention to the serious problems facing our country and let the people of the United Kingdom decide their own political future.
"‚ùå Gut the Voting Rights Act
‚ùå Cut early voting
‚ùå Purge voter rolls
‚ùå Close polling locations
‚ùå Pass restrictive voter ID laws

When I look at the Republican Party‚Äôs efforts to make it harder for people to vote, I have to wonder: Do they truly believe in democracy?"
"This is what oligarchy looks like. 

Amazon used its enormous wealth and power to kill a tax to build affordable housing in Seattle. One year later, thousands of people live on the streets, and the city continues to struggle with the crisis."
"Thank you, Reginald Brown, for sharing your story. I am proud to stand with you to make sure we do not go backward on health care. We are fighting for Medicare for All to make sure that Reginald and every HIV-positive American can afford the lifesaving medicine they need to live."
We have got to end the embarrassment of being the only major country on Earth that does not guarantee paid leave.
"If the Majority Leader wants to defend starvation wages to the people of Kentucky, that is his right. 

But I say to Mitch McConnell: let the American people have a vote on a $15 minimum wage."
"The Green New Deal is not only about saving our planet, it is about creating millions of jobs for the American people‚Äîfamily-sustaining, union jobs with benefits. Thank you, @SEIU. This is what leadership and solidarity are about."
Trump backs Saudi Arabia's war in Yemen and sells them bombs they drop on children. Now he wants @Raytheon to help Saudis develop their own weapons. Congress must stop this president from doing the bidding of the arms industry and this brutal regime.
This is corruption in plain sight. Remember when Mr. Trump told us that he was going to drain the swamp? What a joke.
"As we come together to celebrate #NationalDoughnutDay, let me be perfectly clear: contrary to what you may hear from Fox News, Medicare for All will not limit your donut consumption.

We cannot glaze over the fact that America does not guarantee health care as a human right."
I want to applaud @RepJoeNeguse for this passionate defense of country's immigrants and Dreamers‚Äîkids who are American in every way but a piece of paper.
"It's no secret the @SenateGOP does corporate America's bidding. Well, guess what? Thanks to workers standing up, Amazon and Disney now pay $15 an hour.

So I'm asking @Senatemajldr McConnell: if huge corporations can raise wages, why can't you? Let us vote on a $15 minimum wage."
"75 years ago at Normandy, the United States and its allies led the largest land invasion in history to help free Europe from Nazi barbarism. We will never forget the young people who gave their lives. We honor them by working toward a world of freedom, dignity and peace for all."
Thousands of transgender individuals are often disrespected and denied health care services due to their gender identity. That‚Äôs unacceptable. The Equality Act is an important first step to ensure the transgender community gets the respect and dignity they deserve. #PrideMonth
"Are you a student or recent graduate? Apply for a paid internship in Senator Sanders' Burlington and Washington, D.C. offices, including press internships. Applications are due on June 22nd."
"Trump‚Äôs border wall request: $8.6 billion
Tax cuts for the wealthy: $1.5 trillion
""Space Force"" annual budget: $1.3 billion
Soccer and legal aid for children locked up at the border: $0
 
How obscene is it that this administration blames ‚Äúbudget pressures‚Äù to punish little kids."
"Wall Street bankers say @AOC and I are wrong to advance the Loan Shark Prevention Act, which would put an end to sky-high interest rates on loans and credit cards. Guess what? They're wrong.

Now economists are joining the fight. And they are on our side."
"Mr. Trump now says he prefers to talk to Iran, after threatening a disastrous military conflict with them. Good.

The president can show he is serious about diplomacy by rejoining the nuclear deal he recklessly withdrew from last year."
"Trump's Mexico tariffs aren't about trade, it's about a fake border ""crisis"" to scapegoat migrants. No wonder it's unpopular. We should be working to address migration‚Äôs root causes by ending our militarized drug war and race-to-the-bottom trade policies."
"China, with one-third our per capita income, leads on electric vehicles and renewable energy, while Trump says climate change is a hoax.
 
A Green New Deal would invest in building our electric buses, trains and cars here in America with good union wages."
"For the millions of DREAMers and TPS holders whose lives have been thrown into chaos by Mr. Trump‚Äôs bigotry, we have got to pass this legislation now. I call on Senator Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to bring this bill to the floor for a vote immediately."
"LGBTQ people face unacceptable workplace discrimination and abuse. I say to the huge corporations rainbow-branding themselves for #PrideMonth:

Pay your employees fairly.
Let them unionize.
Support their right to health care.

Do not cheapen the struggle for dignity and freedom."
Let's not forget that the middle class was built by organized labor. I am very concerned to see that @BuzzFeed still hasn't recognized the union formed by its newsroom employees. Our Workplace Democracy Act will put an end to corporations getting away with these stalling tactics.
"I cannot understand this way of thinking from White House advisor Jared Kushner. It is not moral to have benefitted from the safe haven America provided our parents and grandparents fleeing violence, only to then slam the door shut on today's refugees."
I believe it is wrong to charge Americans astronomical prices for life-saving drugs developed with taxpayer dollars. You will not find me encouraging pharmaceutical companies to continue ripping off Americans like my Republican colleagues.
I‚Äôve said it before and I‚Äôll say it again: It is outrageous that the Walton family makes more in one minute than a Walmart worker earns in a year. It is not radical to end taxpayer subsidies for this wealthy corporation and have it pay its employees a living wage of $15 an hour.
"22 Senators just voted for an extreme budget to cut Medicare and Medicaid IN HALF, throwing millions off their health care, while extending Trump's tax cuts for the ultra-wealthy.

When Republicans tell us who they are and what they want for this country, we should believe them."
"Big surprise: Under Trump, another head of a federal agency who is supposed to serve the public good is actually furthering family and business interests. The corruption and nepotism of this administration, from Trump on down, never ends."
The Trump administration serves one group of people in America: the top 1%.
"I applaud New Hampshire for becoming the 21st state to abolish the death penalty. Too many innocent people, particularly racial minorities, get caught up in this unjust policy. A civilized society shouldn‚Äôt be involved in the murder of other Americans."
More proof that this administration wants to rig the 2020 Census to undercount minorities‚Äîand they‚Äôre trying to cover it up. The census must not be turned into a partisan weapon. Immigrant communities have a right to equal representation and funding.
"The 2008 Wall Street bailout was never meant to help ordinary people. It only emboldened Wall Street‚Äôs greed, recklessness and fraud. Bonuses went up, no one went to jail. That‚Äôs why I voted against it. It‚Äôs time to break up the big banks once and for all."
"Nonpartisan experts confirmed to @HouseBudgetDems that #MedicareforAll could offer universal coverage, lower costs, and stronger wages. I applaud @USProgressives @RepJohnYarmuth, @RepJayapal and @RepRoKhanna for holding this hearing to build the case for health care as a right."
"How sick is Trump's revolving door? The current head of the EPA protecting our air is Andrew Wheeler, an ex-coal lobbyist. Before him, Scott Pruitt ignored his own scientists to make Wisconsin breathe in more smog. Now he works for the coal industry, too."
"In support of our wonderful ‚Äúally,‚Äù Saudi Arabia, Trump has provoked war with Iran and kept us in an unconstitutional war in Yemen. Instead of giving the Saudis more bombs, he should take a hard look at the brutal, antidemocratic regime he loves so much."
"If Eddie Lampert has enough money to buy a $130-million, 288-foot yacht, he damn well has enough money to pay the $43 million severance package he promised to the workers at Sears, whose jobs were destroyed as a result of his greed and mismanagement."
"How can it be that six migrant children have died in U.S. custody in the last eight months? In the previous decade, this hadn't happened even once. 

We need an investigation. Trump's racism, xenophobia and incompetence cannot be allowed to continue."
"As a candidate, Trump promised he'd stop outsourcing good-paying American jobs. He lied. 

Instead, by protecting their patents, Trump is trying to make it easier for corporations like Pfizer, GE, Boeing and Microsoft to ship more American jobs to China."
Nurses know better than anyone how our for-profit health care system is incompatible with health care itself. I applaud @NationalNurses for their leadership to guarantee health care is a human right for all.
"In America today, the average student-loan debt for a four-year degree is over $28,000.
 
When asked how big their student debt was, people from Denmark, Taiwan, Ireland, Brazil, the Philippines, Scotland, Turkey, and Canada all gave the same answer: $0."
"Given the reality that we have a president who believes he is above the law, Congress must continue its investigations. If the House Judiciary Committee deems it necessary, I will support their decision to open an impeachment inquiry."
"McConnell said he‚Äôd fill a Supreme Court vacancy in 2020 after blocking hearings for Merrick Garland. What a hypocrite. Make no mistake about it, McConnell's goal has always been the same: lifetime appointments for extreme rightwing judges by any means."
"This is insane: As Oklahoma and Arkansas face catastrophic flooding, and Ohio and Indiana reel from tornados, Trump is trying to undermine the very science that proves climate change is real. We need policy based on facts, not rightwing ideology."
"This is a public health crisis: The last remaining clinic in Missouri that provides safe, legal abortion could be shut down within hours. We must fight the extremists who, in state after state, are waging a war against women."
"The establishment says there's no alternative to an unfettered capitalism that produces huge CEO bonuses while millions are paid starvation wages. They are dead wrong. Instead of more tax breaks to profitable corporations, let‚Äôs expand employee ownership."
".@AGWilliamTong and 43 other attorneys general have damning proof that major drug companies have been colluding on price, stealing billions from American patients and taxpayers.

I look forward to working with him to ensure they are prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law."
"This Memorial Day, we say to veterans who came home from war that we honor your service, and we will make sure every man and woman who has served our country gets the very best health care they can through a strong Veterans Administration."
"Today, on this Memorial Day, we remember and honor all those men and women who gave their lives to defend our country, American values and our democracy. Their sacrifice will not be forgotten."
I say to the right-wing extremists who want to roll back Roe v. Wade: Abortion is a constitutional right and we are going to keep it that way.
"How many kids suffer from mercury, lead, and soot in their air? And the most polluting incinerators in America hurt low-income and minority neighborhoods the most. We need clean air and water for all‚Äînot a government that works on behalf of polluters."
"I agree with these 76 retired generals and admirals, who warn that a war with Iran would be a disaster for the region and for U.S. security, and who urge Trump to pursue diplomacy rather than an unnecessary conflict."
I understand President Trump is blocking a resolution at the @WHO that would require drug companies to disclose actual R&amp;D costs for pharmaceutical drugs. Nobody should believe Mr. Trump when he talks about taking on Big Pharma.
"Let me be clear: it is a disturbing attack on the First Amendment for the Trump administration to decide who is or is not a reporter for the purposes of a criminal prosecution. Donald Trump must obey the Constitution, which protects the publication of news about our government."
"Young people have already demonstrated that they can take on powerful fossil fuel companies and force politicians to answer their call to action. 

To the more than 1 million people walking out for climate justice today: I stand with you."
"I was right about Vietnam.

I was right about Iraq.

I will do everything in my power to prevent a war with Iran.

I apologize to no one."
"Trump said he would ‚Äústop Wall Street from getting away with murder."" Instead, he deregulated Wall Street and gave them a $20 billion tax break. 

I've got a better idea. We're going to make Wall Street pay its fair share and stop reckless speculation."
I support the Transport Workers Union in their struggle against American Airlines. This is what a strong union and strong union leadership is about:
"It is obvious that the President is a pathological liar who does not understand the Constitution. The fact is that if Mr. Trump continues to disregard the right of Congress to subpoena, he will leave House Members with no choice but to begin an impeachment inquiry."
"Thank you @chefjoseandres for stopping by to talk about the amazing work you did in Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria! The full resources of the United States must be used to ensure that Puerto Rico gets the food, water, housing, and electricity they still desperately need."
"""How do you pay for it?"" This is how. 

Watch live as @RepBarbaraLee and I introduce legislation to tax Wall Street greed."
"Yes, facts matter. Delta workers don't make as little as $9 an hour. They make as little as $8.25 an hour. It's time for Delta's CEO to stop misleading, stop discouraging workers from joining a union and pay all of them a living wage with good benefits."
"This afternoon, I attended a Senate intelligence briefing where the Trump administration presented its policy on Iran. Without going into specifics, let me just say: If you think the war in Iraq was a disaster, in all likelihood a war with Iran would be far worse."
"It is obvious Secretary DeVos wants to dismantle and privatize public education. No wonder she calls unions and local governments an ""empire"" to defeat. Our communities need an advocate for public education, not a billionaire advancing the interests of for-profit industry."
"Can you believe this? We, as taxpayers, spent millions to develop a treatment for HIV. @GileadSciences disregarded our government patent to charge $2,000 a month for the very same drug. We have got to stop Big Pharma from price-gouging the American people."
"Trump, the schoolyard bully, is threatening to take us into another war in the Middle East. Just what we need! But it will not be Trump's or his billionaire friend's kids and grandkids who fight and die in that war. It will be working-class kids. No war with Iran!"
Billionaire Robert F. Smith's gift to forgive the student debts of the graduating class of Morehouse College was extremely generous. But the student crisis will not be solved by charity. It must be addressed by governmental action.
"The people of Yemen are suffering because of a disastrous, brutal war. We should be ending that war, not funding it. On this issue and many others, I don‚Äôt see why we would want to be seen as a close ally of Saudi Arabia, which is a despotic, un-democratic regime."
"Black babies make up only 14% of the infant population, yet make up 30% of all infant deaths. That is unacceptable. We must address the systemic and implicit racism present in maternal care for black mothers, as well as other mothers of color."
"Congratulations to all those in House of Representatives who voted on the right side of history today. All people, regardless of who they are or who they love, deserve fair and equal treatment. #EqualityAct"
"I fully support these medical workers in Ohio, who are striking to make St. Vincent Medical Center put patients over profits. They are on the right side of history."
"To the @SenateMajldr: The House did its job. Now, I call on you to bring the #EqualityAct to the Senate floor so that we finally protect LGBTQ people across America from discrimination in housing, employment and other critical parts of their lives. 

Do your job."
"Today's modern-day loan sharks are no longer lurking on street corners‚Äîthey wear Armani suits and work on Wall Street.
 
@RepAOC and I have a ‚Äúradical‚Äù idea: no bank in America should charge an interest rate higher than 15%."
It is not an American value to talk about rounding up millions of people and throwing them out of the country. That is xenophobia and racism.
"Mr. Trump and his cabinet cannot seem to get on the same page when it comes to raising the min. wage to $15 an hour. It is not that complicated: Too many Americans are working 40+ hours a week and still cannot afford basic necessities. They need a living wage, not poverty pay."
"We know what the goal of the far right is: overturn Roe v. Wade and outlaw all abortion in America. It is not a stretch to say that this would, quite literally, kill women. Here's how we fight back:"
"Should antitrust action be taken against Facebook? The answer is yes, of course. We have an increasingly monopolistic society, where you have a handful of very large corporations with far too much power over American consumers. That has got to change."
"This is sickening. We have seen a terrible level of police violence against unarmed African Americans: Sandra Bland, Rekia Boyd and now Pamela Turner. We need an investigation of this shooting and immediate reform to our racist criminal justice system."
"The same CEOs who say we can't afford to guarantee health care as a right had no problem paying themselves $2.6 billion last year. 

Working together, we will end the greed and profiteering of private health insurance companies and move to #MedicareforAll."
"This woman's mother died of a self-induced abortion in 1944, when abortions were strictly criminal. In limiting access to abortion, all we are doing is eliminating safe and monitored abortions."
Workers have the constitutional right to form a union and negotiate for better wages. Delta‚Äôs union-busting tactics are reprehensible. My colleagues and I urge Delta's CEO to end this insulting and demeaning campaign of intimidation.
"The Alabama Senate voted to outlaw nearly all abortions. These hypocrites decry ""big government,"" yet they want to control every aspect of women's bodies, private decisions, and futures.
 
Our job is to fight at every step to protect reproductive rights."
The United States Congress must do everything it can to prevent the Trump Administration‚Äôs attempts to put us on the brink of a catastrophic and unconstitutional war with Iran.
"Join me live on Twitter and Facebook in a few moments, as I lay out my strong opposition to the Trump Administration's attempts to put us on the brink of a catastrophic and unconstitutional war with Iran."
"From disenfranchising ex-felons to extreme gerrymandering, here are the 5 ways the Republican party is trying to suppress the vote. The great political crisis we face is not voter fraud, which barely exists. It is voter suppression and the denial of voting rights."
"NO WAR WITH IRAN! This would be an unmitigated disaster. We must stop Trump and his national security advisor, John Bolton‚Äîsomeone who likes endless wars."
"Pharma executives allegedly deleted their texts and lied to our offices to conceal a conspiracy to fix prices, raising them by as much as 1000%. How many have died as a result of this racket? @RepCummings and I will hold these companies accountable."
"When we rally for a Green New Deal, we are rallying to create millions of good clean energy jobs, rallying for racial justice, and rallying to save the only planet that we have. Watch live now at @sunrisemvmt or at"
"Mr. President: Stop dividing the American people up by their religion, their race or their country of origin--and stop your ugly attacks against Muslim women in Congress. You are taking Rep. @RashidaTlaib's comments out of context and should apologize."
"Victor Orban is undermining democracy in Hungary, just as Donald Trump is in the United States. The job of the President of the United States should be to stand up for democratic values, not embrace leaders who reject them."
"In The Divine Comedy, Dante reserved a special place in the Seventh Circle of Hell for people who charged usurious interest rates. Today we don‚Äôt need the hellfire, but we do need a national usury law that caps interest rates on credit cards and consumer loans at 15 percent."
"Jane and I, our four kids and seven grandchildren, want to take this opportunity to wish all of the great mothers of our country a very happy Mother's Day."
"Making certain that future generations have a planet that is healthy and habitable is a moral imperative. With their activism, young people are taking the lead in the fight against climate change. I look forward to speaking to the @sunrisemvmt tomorrow."
"How insane is this. We tell young people to get the best education they can, and then saddle them for decades with student debt. We must make public colleges and universities tuition-free, and substantially reduce student debt."
"Think of it. Instead of spending trillions on wars, strong U.S. presidential leadership could bring the world together in the fight against climate change and the need to transform our energy system away from fossil fuels."
"Once again, our critics are wrong: a new study found that in cities and states where wages went up, other low-wage workers got a bump in pay, and overall employment did not decrease. 

It's long past time for Congress to pass a $15-an-hour living wage."
I applaud Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes for sounding the alarm on the dangers of unchecked corporate power. We are living in an era of monopolies that dominate every aspect of our lives‚Äîincluding our government. It‚Äôs time to take that power back.
"Rep. Ocasio-Cortez is right. The big banks prey on poor people with high interest rates or ignore them entirely. 

The vast majority of postal services around the world allow their customers to use basic banking services without outrageous fees and interest rates. So should we."
"88 percent of the American people support capping credit card interest rates. They are sick and tired of being ripped off by Wall Street banks that are making record profits. 

Working together, we will end their greed."
"Credit card interest rates are outrageously high. With @RepAOC, we are introducing legislation to challenge the greed of Wall Street and protect  consumers across America."
My colleague @RepAOC and I have a radical idea: maybe Congress should stand up for ordinary people. Join us at noon today on Twitter as we launch our legislation to protect consumers and take on the greed of the big banks.
"At a time when climate change is the greatest crisis facing the planet, Microsoft and Google are making billion dollar deals with the fossil fuel industry. 

Our job: Break our addiction to fossil fuels and transform our energy system toward sustainable sources of energy."
I urge Catalyst Pharmaceuticals to respond to this FDA decision by lowering its own outrageous prices. No patient should worry about whether they will suffer or die just to increase the obscene profits of a pharmaceutical company.
"Today, I went to the the National Archives, where our Constitution is housed, to say to @realDonaldTrump: You are not a dictator and you must obey the Constitution."
"By withdrawing from the Iran nuclear agreement, a move opposed by his own top security officials, Trump has isolated the U.S. from its closest allies and put us on a dangerous path to conflict. We should rejoin the deal and work with allies to effectively enforce it."
The House Judiciary Committee is doing the right thing by voting to hold Mr. Barr in contempt of Congress for defying a subpoena. No Attorney General is above the law. Mr. Barr must testify‚Äîthe American people have a right to know.
Uber and Lyft drivers are struggling as they work for billion-dollar companies. These drivers are not ‚Äúindependent contractors‚Äù‚Äîthey are employees who deserve rights and benefits. I stand in solidarity with them as they strike today for a dignified life.
"There's no doubt in my mind that Sandra Bland, like too many African Americans who die in police custody, would be alive today if she were a white woman. I support her family‚Äôs call for a renewed investigation into her arrest and death."
This blatant and unconstitutional attack on women's rights must be stopped. Women have a fundamental right to control their own bodies and futures.
"Monopolies are harming the livelihoods of rural Americans. A handful of companies dominate the markets for seeds, equipment, meat packing, and patents. We need to put an end to corporate mergers and break up Big Ag so family farmers can get a fair shake."
"Unlike Donald Trump, most Americans do not believe that a free press is ""the enemy of the people."" I am delighted that Reuters journalists Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo were released from a Myanmar prison after 500 days in prison."
"Congratulations to the advocates in Oregon who won a major victory today. The right to a clean environment is more important than the short-term profits of the fossil fuel industry. Our job: break our addiction to fossil fuels, not increase our dependence on fracked natural gas."
I am so grateful to America's nurses. Nurses are the backbone of our health care system and it is no wonder Americans trust them more than any other profession. They deserve tremendous respect and support from all of us.
"We must combat oligarchy. A new study shows that the top 10% now own 70% of the wealth, while the bottom half have virtually no net wealth at all. We need an economy that works for all, not just the few."
The people of Puerto Rico have been experiencing a humanitarian crisis for over a year and a half since Hurricane Maria. It is totally unconscionable that in the wealthiest nation in the world we have allowed our fellow citizens to suffer for so long.
"The average household with credit card debt owes over $15,000. 

The average interest rate on these cards? Above 17%.
 
Soon, I‚Äôll introduce legislation to put a stop to this. How have steep interest rates and fees impacted you? Please share your story."
"Climate change is destroying our ecosystems and our planet. We must take on the greed of the fossil fuel industry, and transform our energy system away from fossil fuel to energy efficiency and sustainable energy."
"Sorry, Mr. President, you are not a dictator. In our democracy, when Congress calls on Robert Mueller to testify, he will testify."
"This is obscene: while the top 25 hedge-fund managers each take home an average of $850 million a year, nearly half of college students have to skip meals for the crime of pursuing an education. We must ensure tuition-free college for all, funded by a tax on Wall Street greed."
The United States lags behind every major country on Earth when it comes to paid sick leave. It is time for Congress to follow the lead of states like mine and pass guaranteed sick leave for all Americans.
There can be no free society without a free media. The work of journalists in this country is absolutely essential to our communities and to a free and functioning democracy. Journalists should never have to fear for their lives as they do their work. #WorldPressFreedomDay
"We have a racist criminal justice system that costs us billions of dollars, ruins lives and allows private prisons to profit off of human misery. The private prison racket has got to end."
"In the richest country in the history of the world, 13 million children live in poverty and two-thirds of them are children of color. This is a moral outrage. If we raise the minimum wage and invest in education and housing, we can end child poverty."
"When Congress asks the Attorney General to testify or provide information, he's got to do it. I support those who are prepared to hold him in contempt for stonewalling. The American people are entitled to this information and the House should be as tough as they can be."
"The Trump administration is threatening a disastrous military intervention in Venezuela. Under our Constitution, only Congress can authorize the use of force. We must make sure the United States does not get involved in yet another war and destabilize another region."
Watch live now: A bipartisan majority in the House and the Senate voted to end U.S. support for the Saudi-led war in Yemen. We can save thousands upon thousands of people if we override Donald Trump's veto.
Lives are at stake. I‚Äôm on my way to vote to override Donald Trump‚Äôs veto of our bipartisan resolution to stop U.S. involvement in the Saudi war in Yemen.
"I thank my friend @JoeBiden for joining our effort to end U.S. involvement in the Saudi military campaign in Yemen, which, over four years of war, has experienced the world's worst humanitarian crisis. We must override
@realDonaldTrump's veto."
"I am proud to have worked with @USProgressives in the House to challenge the devastating cuts to education, health care and pensions imposed on the people of Puerto Rico. I applaud @RepRaulGrijalva for hosting a hearing to chart a just and equitable way forward."
"Today, the Senate will vote on overriding Trump's veto of our bipartisan bill to end unlawful U.S. participation in the Saudi-led war in Yemen. This is not about partisan politics. What‚Äôs at stake are millions of innocent lives and our Constitution. I urge my colleagues vote yes."
"Today on #CollegeSigningDay, my staff and I want to celebrate students in Vermont and across the country for their hard work and determination. Congratulations on continuing your education!"
"My staff went to the offices of my Senate colleagues to share a new UN report showing that 233,000 people will die as a result of the Saudi-led war in Yemen by 2019.
 
If we override Trump's veto of our resolution and end U.S. support for this war, we can save thousands of lives."
"What a hypocrite: While Trump demonizes immigrants, his New York country club exploits undocumented workers and steals their wages. Together, we will build an economy that treats all workers with dignity."
Attorney General Barr's handling of the Mueller report has been a disaster. This is what I feared and why I opposed his nomination. I look forward to Special Counsel Mueller's testimony and believe Congress must continue to investigate whether the president obstructed justice.
"Remember when Mr. Trump promised the typical American family a $4,000 pay raise? That was a lie. 

The average worker has received an increased bonus of just 1 cent an hour since the Trump tax scam was signed into law."
"""The whole myth that if you like your current insurance you can keep it - you know that is just not true."" 

This man suffers from 'job-lock' because he cannot afford to forgo his employer-based insurance. Our health care system is broken. That is why we need Medicare for All."
"Our time on this Earth is precious. Let us honor the tremendous strength and courage of @AdyBarkan by watching his moving testimony, sharing it widely, and working tirelessly to pass #MedicareforAll to guarantee health care to every man, woman and child."
"For far too long, the United States has basically had a one-party foreign policy that favors militarism over diplomacy. Thanks to the hard work of many progressives, working on Yemen and other issues, that is finally changing."
"Secretary Pompeo should stop misleading the American people about the Yemen war. The fact is that Iran's role is minimal, and continued U.S. support for this Saudi-led catastrophe undermines our national security."
"What would be truly heroic is if Disney used its profits from Avengers to pay all of its workers a middle class wage, instead of paying its CEO Bob Iger $65.6 million ‚Äì over 1,400 times as much as the average worker at Disney makes."
"The American people are sick and tired of profitable corporations like Amazon, General Motors, Chevron and Delta making billions in profits, but paying nothing in federal income taxes. Working together, we will end a rigged tax code and political system."
"""I may be dying, but I‚Äôm definitely not going quietly."" 

While battling terminal illness, @AdyBarkan will testify before the House Rules Committee in favor of #MedicareforAll. I want to thank him and the millions of Americans who are fighting to make health care a human right."
"A new UN-commissioned report shows that the impact of the Yemen war on civilians, particularly children, is far worse than previously thought. 

Congress must vote to overturn Trump‚Äôs veto of our resolution and end US support for this disastrous war."
"I am so proud of the youth fighting against climate change. I thank them for their relentless work in the fight for a cleaner, safer world."
"Six trillion dollars have been spent on the so-called war on terror. That is an unbelievable amount of money. Do we really need to spend more than the next ten nations combined on the military, when our infrastructure is collapsing and young people can't afford to go to college?"
This economy leaves far too many working people struggling to make ends meet. That has got to change.
"- Americans borrowed $88 billion last year to pay for health care
- 65 million people didn't seek treatment because of cost
 
That is outrageous. Under Medicare for All, no one would have to worry about being able to afford the health care they need."
"In the richest country in the history of the world, it is not radical to demand that when people turn on their taps, the water they drink is safe and clean. It has been 5 years since the start of the Flint water crisis. This is absolutely unacceptable."
"A $15 minimum wage once seemed impossible. 

Since then, 6 states raised the minimum wage to $15 an hour. 29 states raised it above the national minimum of $7.25 an hour. 

Thanks to a strong grassroots movement, $15 has gone from laughable to inevitable."
"Yesterday's mass execution underscores how urgent it has become for the United States to redefine our relationship with the despotic regime in Saudi Arabia, and to show that the Saudis do not have a blank check to continue violating human rights and dictating our foreign policy."
The stock prices of massive pharmaceutical companies tumbled because we are pushing to make health care a human right for every American. Corporate greed has no place in health care.
Twenty-six of the wealthiest people on Earth own more than the bottom half of the world‚Äôs population. A handful of people at the top own more than 3.6 billion people. How grotesque is that?
President Trump's veto of our bipartisan resolution to end U.S. support for the Saudi-led war in Yemen is a very serious challenge to Congressional authority that demands a response. We must vote to override his veto.
"Today is #EarthDay. Unless we take bold action to reverse climate change, future generations will look back and ask a very simple question: ""Where were they? Why didn‚Äôt the United States of America lead on preventing the devastating damage that scientists were sure would come?"""
"The fight for Medicare for All will be opposed by some of the most powerful forces in our country. Like most movements, this fight will not be without struggle. But the American people are clear in demanding a system that guarantees health care to every man, woman and child."
This is exactly the kind of future we must fight for. We have 11 short years to come together to massively transition away from fossil fuels to prevent catastrophic climate change. I am proud to co-sponsor the Green New Deal with my good friends @EdMarkey and @AOC.
"I wrote about the courageous Yemeni human rights defender @RAlmutawakel, who is documenting the terrible human cost of U.S. support for Saudi Arabia's war, for @TIME's #TIME100 issue."
"Medicare for All means:

‚úÖ No copays
‚úÖ No deductibles
‚úÖ Freedom of choice in doctors and hospitals
‚úÖ Coverage for every American

The function of our current system is to make billions of dollars for the insurance and drug companies. That is what instability looks like."
"The people of Yemen desperately need humanitarian help, not more bombs.

I am disappointed, but not surprised, that Trump has rejected the bi-partisan resolution to end U.S. involvement in the horrific war in Yemen."
"In my view, it is long past time that we in the United States end the federal prohibition on marijuana. Now is the time to decriminalize marijuana and expunge criminal records associated with the drug."
Republicans and the wealthiest Americans have worked to cut the IRS to benefit themselves. This is what a rigged economy and political system looks like.
"The bigotry of the Trump administration is shameful. Our job must be to stand with the transgender community, repeal this hateful policy, and fight against discrimination wherever it appears."
"Congratulations to the over 6,000 Amazon employees who are demanding their employer address the global crisis of climate change. This letter is a step in the right direction. We must come together to ensure we leave a habitable planet for our kids and grandchildren."
"This is outrageous: Nurses are being forced to stop critical procedures for patients because of the insurance industry. Medicare For All would give power back to health professionals, where it belongs."
"The White House is scared. They say Medicare for All is the health care version of the Green New Deal. 

Damn right! This is about human rights. And we are going to win this struggle."
"The number of huge profitable companies like Chevron and Netflix that are paying nothing in federal income taxes has doubled, because of Donald Trump's tax giveaways to the rich and large corporations. Nothing in federal income taxes.

That is a disgrace."
"Trump's NAFTA 2.0 is filled with giveaways for Big Pharma and major corporations. We need trade agreements that build an inclusive economy for all, not just the 1%."
"The Trump administration keeps lying. They want to throw 32 million people off insurance, end protections for pre-existing conditions and raise premiums.
 
Here's the truth about Medicare for All: It means never having to worry about being able to afford the health care you need."
"I'm proud to introduce the Medicare for All Act of 2019.

It's simple: No deductibles, no surprise bills for out-of-network services, and no copays. And if you change jobs, no changing insurance plans or worrying about losing the coverage that you and your family depend on."
"If every major country on the planet can guarantee health care to all and achieve better health outcomes, while spending less per capita, please do not tell us that the United States of America cannot do the same. If we were to pass #MedicareForAll tomorrow, lives would be saved."
"34 million Americans do not have health insurance, and thousands die each year because they cannot afford medical care. Today we reintroduced #MedicareForAll so that every American can get the health care they need."
"Let's make history. Let's bring an end to a system that allowed 5 insurance corporations to make $20 billion in profits last year, while 1 in 5 Americans could not afford their prescriptions. Let's pass #MedicareForAll.

Watch live now:"
"We all want a strong defense, but the United States should not be spending $733 billion on the military ‚Äì more than the next 10 countries combined.  We should be investing in education and infrastructure, not endless wars."
"Tomorrow, I'm introducing the Medicare for All Act of 2019.

-70% of Americans support it
-More than a dozen Senate co-sponsors
-Endorsed by more than 50 nat'l orgs
-Covers long-term services, ensuring care for people with disabilities

Health care is a RIGHT, not a privilege."
Tax Day is around the corner and guess what? Corporations are lobbying for a new law that would prevent the government from offering you a free and easy online way to pay your taxes. The system is rigged and we need to drastically change it to protect the public.
"Hey Mr. President, take your absurd ideas on climate change solutions and put them back where they came from."
Congress made history this week by passing my resolution with @SenMikeLee to cut off U.S. support for Saudi-led forces in the civil war in Yemen.
Today we passed an historic war powers resolution to end U.S. support for the Saudi-led war in Yemen. Watch our press conference live now.
"Today we took a clear stand against war and famine and for Congress‚Äô war powers by voting to end our complicity in the war in Yemen.
 
This is just the beginning of a national debate over when and where we go to war and Congress‚Äô authority over those interventions."
"The House will vote soon on our resolution to end U.S. support for the Saudi-led war in Yemen, which has created the world's worst humanitarian crisis. Trump has said he opposes ""endless wars."" He can show us he means it by signing this resolution when it comes to his desk."
No American should have to go without basic health care. Community health centers are a critical lifeline for millions of Americans. @WhipClyburn and I are working to expand them to everyone who needs care.
We have a crisis in primary health care. @WhipClyburn and I are introducing legislation to fix it and provide health care to millions of Americans.
I frankly do not understand why Republicans seem to hate providing health care to the American people.
Next week the House will vote on our resolution to end US support for the Yemen war. I urge my House colleagues to reject any effort to undermine the resolution with a motion to recommit. It‚Äôs time to pass this resolution and send it to the president.
"Do you want to know what's crazy? Last year, Amazon and Netflix, to name a couple companies, paid no federal income taxes after making billions in profits."
"Over a year after Hurricane Maria, Puerto Rico is still struggling to recover. It is unconscionable that Trump has allowed our fellow citizens to suffer for so long. To the people of Puerto Rico: you are not forgotten. We will do everything we possibly can to rebuild the island."
"The Sackler family has made billions of dollars selling opioids. Their greed, which is killing Americans, must end."
"The Senate Republican Budget: 

- Throws 32 million off healthcare 
- Cuts Medicare and Medicaid 
- Kicks 175,000 kids off Head Start 
- Denies nutrition assistance to 5 million pregnant moms and babies 
- Provides more tax breaks to the Top 1%"
"Mitch McConnell and the Republican Party don't believe we have to address climate change, the major crisis facing this planet. That is a disgrace. 

We need a Green New Deal that says we are going to boldly confront climate change and create millions of jobs in the process."
"Over 30,000 Americans could die every single year if Trump gets his way and destroys the Affordable Care Act. 
 
Our job is to fight back against his efforts to take health care away from millions of people. We must make health care a right through Medicare for All."
Discrimination has no place in our society. I am proud to display this flag as a symbol of my support for transgender people across the country. We must stand with transgender people in all of our communities.
"Puerto Rico is in dire need of increased food assistance funding.

It's unconscionable that we've allowed our fellow Americans to suffer for so long without the full resources of the U.S. government. 

We must act now to end this crisis."
I'm proud to stand in solidarity with the employees at Ford GoBike in San Francisco who are voting to join the Transport Workers Union on March 28th. We cannot have a strong and vibrant middle class without a strong and vibrant trade union movement.
"I‚Äôm proud to stand in solidarity with 1,500 grad workers at the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) who are on strike for a living wage. I say to UIC: Sit down at the bargaining table. Negotiate in good faith. Pay your workers a living wage."
"While Trump provided a trillion dollar tax giveaway to the top 1% and profitable corporations, his budget would deny high-quality childcare and early childhood education to nearly 150,000 kids by cutting Head Start by $7.6 billion over the next ten years."
"Trump's budget would take away nutrition assistance from more than 1 million pregnant women, infants and children by cutting the WIC program by $5.8 billion over the next decade. We must defeat this cruel budget."
"I voted against the war in Iraq. Sadly, much of what I feared in fact did happen. I don't want to see it happen again."
"16 years ago, the United States invaded Iraq. I opposed it at the time, warning of unintended consequences. We are still dealing with those disastrous consequences today and will be for many years. We need a foreign policy that focuses on diplomacy, not war."
Trump‚Äôs proposed increase in base Pentagon spending could make public colleges and universities tuition-free over the next decade.
"Today‚Äôs vote is about much more than a wall or whether there is a national emergency on the southern border. There is not.

It's about whether we are a nation of laws, where the president obeys the Constitution and democratic processes. We will not become an authoritarian nation."
"Are you a student or recent graduate? Apply for a paid internship in Senator Sanders' Burlington and Washington, D.C. offices. Applications are due at 11:59 pm on Saturday, 3/16."
"Trump‚Äôs budget pays for his huge tax break to the top one percent by cutting $1.5 trillion from Medicaid, $845 billion from Medicare and $25 billion from Social Security. That is unacceptable."
"In an historic vote, the Senate sent an important message: we will no longer support Saudi Arabia in causing the worst humanitarian disaster on the planet. Congress will reassert its constitutional authority on issues of war and end U.S. support for the war in Yemen."
"This is historic. For the first time in 45 years, Congress is one step closer to withdrawing U.S. forces from an unauthorized war. We must end the war in Yemen."
The war in Yemen is both a humanitarian and a strategic disaster. Let us bring this catastrophic and unconstitutional war in Yemen to an end today.
Climate change is the existential crisis of our time. Why isn't this something we talk about on the news every day?
This is very good news. We can't properly reform our broken criminal justice system without ending the death penalty. We must abolish the death penalty once and for all.
"Yemen is experiencing the worst humanitarian disaster in the world due to the Saudi-led war. 

The U.S. has been Saudi Arabia's partner in this horrific war. Too often, our weapons are being used to kill civilians. 

Today, the Senate can take a major step toward ending this war."
Wealth inequality in America is at an all-time high. It's time we make millionaires and billionaires pay their fair share.
Donald Trump's budget is not only an absolute disaster ‚Äì full of ideas that the American people have already rejected ‚Äì it exposes Trump for the fraud that he is.
"85,000 children have starved to death in Yemen as a result of the Saudi-led war.

U.S. participation in this war has not been authorized by Congress and is therefore unconstitutional.

Tomorrow the Senate will vote to end U.S. support for this disastrous and unconstitutional war."
"Medicaid covers nearly half of all births in the U.S.

But Donald Trump wants to cut Medicaid by $1.5 trillion.

Our job: Stop Trump's cruel budget and guarantee health care to every woman, man and child in this country, not throw more people off the health care they have."
"Without new funding, more than 1 million Puerto Ricans will be impacted by cuts to their food assistance. Congress must act immediately to end this humanitarian crisis."
"Amazon must recognize that workers' rights don't stop at the minimum wage. 

Amazon must significantly improve working conditions at its warehouses and respect the constitutional right of its employees to form a union and bargain collectively for a better life."
"We spend more on the military than the next 10 countries combined. 

Now Trump is proposing an $861 billion increase in base defense spending over 10 years. 

And he wants to pay for it by cutting over $1 trillion from programs working families depend on. That is a disgrace."
"Trump's budget is breathtaking in its cruelty. It cuts:

- $1.5 trillion from Medicaid
- $845 billion from Medicare
- $25 billion from Social Security

This budget does the exact opposite of what Trump promised the American people."
"This is a budget for the military-industrial complex, for corporate CEOs, for Wall Street and for the billionaire class. 

We don‚Äôt need billions of dollars for a wall that no one wants. We need a budget that works for all Americans, not just Trump and his billionaire friends."
Climate change is the existential crisis of our time. Why isn't this something we talk about on the news every day?
This is a long overdue rebuke from the United Nations Human Rights Council of Saudi Arabia‚Äôs atrocious record on human rights. The United States should put pressure on the Saudi regime to release imprisoned activists and end its persecution of dissidents.
"Puerto Rico needs food assistance funding due to the hurricanes which devastated the island. Some 1.4 million U.S. citizens will face large cuts to their food assistance benefits, 230,000 will lose the benefits entirely. We must act now to end this crisis."
"We must hold Andrew Wheeler, Trump's new EPA secretary and an ex-coal lobbyist, accountable to enact bold and progressive measures to address the climate crisis."
"Without new funding, more than 1 million Puerto Ricans will be impacted by cuts to their food assistance. We must address this crisis immediately and bring Puerto Rico back onto SNAP. @CarmenYulinCruz"
"Congratulations to UE Locals 506 and 618 for their successful effort in standing up for justice and dignity. 

This is a victory for workers across the country who are sick and tired of seeing their standard of living decline as a result of corporate greed."
"In the United States, you should not be in danger of losing your home because you get sick. We need to take on the greed of the pharmaceutical industry and lower drug prices."
"Today I introduced legislation with @NydiaVelazquez that would end unequal treatment of the territories, help Puerto Rico recover from the hurricanes and aid the most vulnerable in our society by providing sustainable economic relief going forward."
"Medicare for All is the only solution to our current wasteful, for-profit health care system."
"Congratulations to @BobbyScott and every Democrat on the @EdLaborCmte for passing legislation to raise the federal minimum wage from a starvation wage of $7.25 an hour to a living wage of $15 an hour.

A job should lift Americans out of poverty, not keep them in it."
Are you a student or recent graduate? Apply for a paid internship in my Burlington or DC office. Applications are due on March 16.
"40% of fast-food workers have reported experiencing sexual harassment. That is simply unacceptable.

We must stand with the brave McDonald‚Äôs workers protesting today to demand the company address this epidemic of sexual harassment."
"American troops have been in Afghanistan for nearly 18 years, Iraq since 2003 and in Syria since 2015.

The American people do not want endless war. 

Congress must reassert its Constitutional authority over the use of force and responsibly end these interventions."
"Americans are being forced to ration life-saving medication because Catalyst Pharmaceuticals raised the price of the drug from $0 to $375,000. That is unconscionable."
"600,000 people, disproportionately people of color, were arrested for possession of marijuana in 2017.

It is time to decriminalize marijuana, expunge past marijuana convictions and end the failed war on drugs."
My friend @RepRoKhanna's excellent questioning of Michael Cohen confirmed that the president is very likely a criminal.
"Today‚Äôs House Oversight hearing with Michael Cohen confirms what we already knew: the president is a liar, a racist, and very likely a criminal."
I hope we will soon vote on this common-sense bill in the Senate and start to stem the tide of gun violence in this country.
"5 states have now passed legislation increasing the minimum wage to $15 an hour. I congratulate the Vermont Senate for doing the same. 

Let's make sure every worker in Vermont and throughout the country has the right to a living wage."
"Wabtec provided some $60 million in payments to the company's 20 top executives as a result of its merger with GE but is now trying to force workers into 12 hour shifts without overtime pay. 

That is outrageous. I stand with UE Local 506 and 618."
"While health insurance and drug companies make billions in profits, thousands of Americans die each year because they lack access to health care.

We must make health care a right, not a privilege. Thank you @RepJayapal for helping to lead the effort to pass Medicare for All."
Americans are sick and tired of corporate America and their wealthy CEOs ripping off working families. I'm proud to stand with the locomotive manufacturing workers of @ueunion Local 506 and 618 in their fight against GE/Wabtec to maintain decent wages and working conditions.
"No surprise. Insurance and drug companies oppose Medicare for All. They make billions in profits from our dysfunctional system and pay their CEOs outrageous amounts.

But we have the people on our side. They understand we must guarantee health care as a right, not a privilege."
"The people of Venezuela are enduring a serious humanitarian crisis. The Maduro government must put the needs of its people first, allow humanitarian aid into the country, and refrain from violence against protesters."
".@UEUnion workers from #UE506 line up to vote to authorize a strike if necessary as negotiations with Wabtec breakdown. 

At stake: weekends, family sustaining wages, job security and 80 years of workers‚Äô rights.

I stand with #UE506 and working Americans everywhere."
This new rule is a disgraceful assault on women's right and an assault on millions of Americans' ability to get the health care they need. Title X funds provide much-needed family planning services for millions of people. Congress must take action to overturn the final rule.
"Combined 2018 profit of Amazon, GM, Netflix &amp; Goodyear: $24.5 billion

Federal income taxes paid: $0

Combined federal tax refund: $275 million

Our job: Repeal all of the Trump tax giveaways to the top 1 percent and large corporations and rebuild the disappearing middle class."
"This drug was free for patients just weeks ago. Now, patients around the country are rationing their medication because they have no idea how they will afford it. 

Meanwhile, Catalyst Pharmaceuticals is set to make hundreds of millions of dollars off their suffering."
"I'm proud to stand in solidarity with the 1,700 locomotive manufacturing workers in Erie, Pennsylvania, who are fighting to keep the pay and benefits they have won as members of the UE union. 

Corporate executives must not use the merger between GE and Wabtec to hurt workers."
"Why does Trump want to repeal the estate tax? Maybe because without it, a majority of the assets held by households worth $100 million or more would never be taxed.
 
We must reduce inequality, not make it worse. Our job is to increase the estate tax on billionaires like Trump."
"Artificial intelligence and robotics are positive creations of the human mind. They should be used to improve the lives of working people, not just to increase corporate profits.  Human beings must control technology, not the other way around."
"Before Social Security was created in 1932, about half of seniors lived in poverty. 

Today, the senior poverty rate is just 8.8% and in 2016 Social Security lifted 22 million Americans out of poverty. 

Our job is not to cut Social Security. Our job is to expand it."
".@billmckibben, a fellow Vermonter, is a great environmental leader. He is an outstanding writer and organizer.  Thanks to Bill, and other leading environmentalists, more and more Americans are fighting to save our planet. Thanks, Bill."
"Trump and his friends believe in voter suppression and billionaires buying elections. 

We want:
‚úÖ Automatic voter registration
‚úÖ The overturn of Citizens United
‚úÖ Election day as a national holiday  

History is on our side. We will win this struggle."
"Let me congratulate the @fightfor15 movement for winning another historic victory.

The American people understand that we must raise the federal minimum wage from a starvation wage of $7.25 an hour to a living wage ‚Äì at least $15 an hour. 

And that is exactly what we'll do!"
"The current fight in DC is about more than a wall. It's about whether we are a nation of laws, where the president obeys the Constitution and democratic processes. The American people must inform Trump that we will not become an authoritarian nation."
"Donald Trump may not like it, but we are not an authoritarian country. We have a constitution and separation of powers. There is no ""national emergency,"" and Trump cannot build his wall without congressional approval."
"The American people, the Congress and the courts must show Trump what the Constitution and separation of powers is about. Trump cannot declare a ""national emergency"" whenever he wants, and spend money on his pet project. Not gonna happen!"
"While I have concerns about this bill, I supported it because I can‚Äôt turn my back on the 2 million federal employees and private contractors who would be forced again to work without pay. I am also concerned about the millions who would be denied access to government services."
"There is not a ""national emergency"" with regard to the southern border. What President Trump is doing is unlawful and must be opposed vigorously in the courts and legislatively."
"The great economic crisis we face is the grotesque level of income and wealth inequality. When so few have so much, and so many have so little, a handful of billionaires end up controlling our economic and political life. That has got to change."
"Today we remember the Parkland students and teachers who lost their lives.

Thank you to the young people who have courageously led the movement to end gun violence. With your leadership and the strong support of the American people we will pass commonsense gun safety legislation"
I applaud my House colleagues for today‚Äôs historic passage of HJ Res 37 ‚Äì ending U.S. support for the disastrous Saudi-led war in Yemen. The Senate must quickly pass this resolution and finally reassert Congress' constitutional authority over war.
"Amazon made $16.8 billion in profits over the past two years but have paid ZERO in federal income taxes. In fact it got a $269 million tax refund.

Our job: Demand large corporations pay their fair share in taxes so that we can rebuild the disappearing middle class."
"I will vote against William Barr‚Äôs nomination. I cannot support someone for attorney general who will not make public the full Mueller report, who opposes a woman‚Äôs right to control her own body and who supports the failed war on drugs. Mr. Barr‚Äôs nomination must be defeated."
"Donald Trump made $694 million in 2016. That means he stopped paying Social Security taxes 40 minutes into the year.

Meanwhile a middle-class worker paid Social Security taxes the entire year.

I say to Trump: pay your fair share. Let's scrap the cap and expand Social Security."
"At a time when half of older Americans have zero retirement savings, we are not going to cut Social Security, as my Republican colleagues have proposed. We are going to expand Social Security and ensure everyone can retire with dignity. #ScrapTheCap"
"The American people understand that a moral society doesn't give tax breaks to billionaires and then cut back on the needs of seniors or people with disabilities, as our Republican colleagues have proposed.

Today, I am introducing legislation to expand Social Security."
"It is not too much to demand that in our democracy, everyone 18 years of age should be automatically registered to vote. End of discussion."
We have got to end the embarrassment of being the only major country on Earth that does not guarantee paid leave. #FAMILYAct
"Our health care system today essentially says that if you happen to be poor, you are less deserving of getting care than a wealthy person. That is fundamentally immoral and that is not the kind of nation we should be."
"Too many seniors are living in desperate poverty, unable to afford their medicine or basic needs. Many Republicans want to cut Social Security benefits. That's wrong. We need to expand them. Tomorrow, I will be outlining my plan to do that."
"How is it that in the richest country in the history of the world, we can't afford to pay everyone a living wage? It's time to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour."
"If Trump shuts down the government again, planes may not be flying. The Association of Flight Attendants believes that another shutdown would threaten the safety and security of airline passengers and employees. No more shutdowns!"
"Today in 1922, researchers at the University of Toronto announced the discovery of insulin. They sold the patent for $1 so it would be available to all.

97 years later, Eli Lilly is charging ~$300 and Americans die because they can‚Äôt afford their medication. Outrageous."
Watch this progressive economist @lenorepalladino explain to Trump's chief economist how large corporations use stock buybacks to enrich their shareholders at the expense of workers.
"Our infrastructure is collapsing, our health care system is dysfunctional, our political system is corrupt and we have massive levels of income and wealth inequality. And Trump spends most of his time talking about a wall. It's time for a real change."
"In the richest country in the world, our teachers should be the best-paid, not among the worst-paid. I stand with Denver teachers. We must invest in public education because our students and teachers deserve better. #DenverTeacherStrike"
"75 years ago, FDR talked about the need to guarantee every person in this country a good job as a fundamental right. That was true in 1944. It is true today."
"Trump gave the top 1% and large corporations $1 trillion in tax breaks.  Now, he wants to repeal the Estate Tax and make his billionaire friends even richer. Wrong! At a time of massive wealth inequality, the very rich must pay their fair share of taxes."
We can no longer tolerate an economy and a political system that have been rigged to benefit the wealthiest Americans in this country at the expense of everyone else.
"Trump is worried about America becoming a ""socialist nation."" That is exactly what Republicans said about Social Security in 1935 and what they said about Medicare in 1965. Guess what? These are the two most popular programs in the country."
"What if, instead giving tax breaks to billionaires and massive corporations, we gave 40 million Americans a raise by making the federal minimum wage a living wage of $15 an hour?"
"Donald Trump rants against undocumented immigrants, and wants to spend billions on a wall to keep them out. Yet, surprise, surprise. Trump's golf clubs and resorts have knowingly hired low-wage undocumented workers for years. What a fraud!"
"While psychologists tell us that ages 0-4 are the most important years of human development, we have a dysfunctional childcare system which underpays staff and is too costly for working families. We need universal, publicly funded childcare."
The U.S. is the most powerful economy on earth and we must lead the world in the fight against climate change. We can do that by passing the Green New Deal to save the planet and create millions of new jobs.
"Under billionaire Eddie Lampert's watch 3,500 Sears stores closed and over 250,000 workers lost their jobs. Lampert must ensure a just transition for Sears workers who lost their jobs due to his greed. Workers deserve severance pay and to have their benefits honored."
Fighting for Medicare for all will mean taking on special interests who will spend enormous sums of money to defend our dysfunctional health care system. They have the money. We have the people.
"The American people are tired of a health care system that works for Wall Street investors, insurance companies and the pharmaceutical industry‚Äîbut ignores their needs. They want to move to a Medicare-for-all, single-payer system."
"President Trump believes we should listen to fossil fuel executives and ignore climate change. 

I believe we should listen to the scientists who tell us we must aggressively combat climate change and transform our energy system to sustainable energy."
"Where did the money from Trump's ""tax cuts for the middle class"" go? To wealthy corporations who have spent $1 trillion buying back their own stock to enrich executives and wealthy shareholders. That's not acceptable."
"Republicans want to cut taxes for Trump's kids and other children of billionaire families. No. It's time to enact a progressive estate tax and start investing in programs that actually help working families, not the top 0.2%."
"Trump's demonization of Latinos is racist, it‚Äôs wrong and it also happens to be factually inaccurate. Undocumented Latino immigrants commit fewer crimes in America than the general public."
I agree with the joint statement from the Virginia House and Senate Democrats. Very serious and credible allegations have been made by two women against Lieutenant Governor Fairfax. He needs to resign.
"President Trump. Do not shut down the government again. Another Trump shutdown would be not only harmful to our federal workers, but also to the safety and security of our nation."
"Donald Trump‚Äôs relentless attacks on our political institutions not only undermine our democracy, they also embolden authoritarian leaders around the world."
"I am proud to be an original co-sponsor of the Green New Deal proposal. We must address the existential crisis of planetary climate change, while at the same time creating millions of good-paying jobs in our country."
"Trump's top intelligence officials, European allies, national security and nonproliferation experts: The Iran nuclear deal works.

Trump: No."
Climate change is an existential disaster facing the entire world. We must transform our energy system away from fossil fuels to energy efficiency and sustainable energy. A Green New Deal can save the planet and create millions of new jobs.
"Mr. Trump, you are dead wrong. This is not a ""hot economy"" when 62 percent of jobs in America cannot support a middle class life."
"Millions of our people are working for starvation wages. Here is the simple truth. Nobody can raise a family or pay the rent on poverty wages of $8 or $9 an hour.

We are the wealthiest country in the world. We can do better. We can raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour."
"Yes, the economy is great‚Äîfor the top 1 percent, who now earn 46 percent of all new income. Not for the nearly 80 percent of Americans living paycheck to paycheck."
"""Our progress has always found refuge in the basic instinct of the American experiment‚Äîto do right by our people. And with a renewed commitment to social and economic justice, we will create a stronger America together."" ‚Äì@staceyabrams"
"Trump talks a lot about ""freedom."" But people are not truly free when they have no health care or can't afford to feed their families. They are not free when they must work 80 hours a week on starvation wages."
"We have got to think big, not small. Canada guarantees free health care for all, Finland provides free tuition at public colleges, France provides generous retirement benefits. We are the wealthiest country on Earth. Why can't we do the same?"
"All Americans have a right to breathe clean air and drink clean water. Yet Andrew Wheeler, Trump's nominee to lead the EPA, won't commit to regulating a family of toxic chemicals found in our drinking water."
"One vial of insulin cost $21 in 1996, compared to $320 in 2018. American lives are being lost because of pharma's greed. That has got to end."
"Tonight, Trump repeated some of the most extreme anti-women attacks coming from the far right. At a time when we see an unprecedented and coordinated attack against a woman‚Äôs right to choose, we must fight to make sure that every woman has the right to control her own body. #SOTU"
"If we are serious about transforming our country, rebuilding the middle class and reinvigorating our democracy: let us bring our people together to take on and defeat a ruling class whose greed is destroying our nation. #SOTU"
"Trump said tonight, ‚ÄúWe are born free, and we will stay free.‚Äù

I say to Trump: People are not truly free when they can‚Äôt afford health care, prescription drugs, or a place to live. People are not free when they cannot retire with dignity or feed their families. #SOTU"
Tonight Trump‚Äîwho in less than two years in the White House has seen 5 aides either plead guilty or be convicted of criminal charges‚Äîclaimed the strength of the economy was dependent on him being free from necessary oversight and investigations. The exact opposite is true. #SOTU
How can a president of the United States give a State of the Union speech and not mention climate change? #SOTU
"Despite what President Trump says, it is not ‚Äúa hot economy‚Äù when 43% of households can't afford to pay for housing, food, child care, health care, transportation and a cell phone without going into debt. That is not a hot economy. #SOTU"
My response to President Trump‚Äôs State of the Union address:
"Now that that‚Äôs over, please watch my friend Stacey Abrams share her message for the country."
Fox News can't believe their own poll says people want to tax the rich. The truth is: The overwhelming majority of the American people want the wealthy to pay their fair share.
"Let me guess. President Trump tonight will talk about crimes committed by undocumented Latinos. Do you think he will mention the mass shootings done by white men, or the need for common sense gun safety legislation?"
Will Trump talk about climate change in his State of the Union address tonight?
"Lloyd Blankfein, the former CEO of Goldman Sachs, is correct that the money from stock buybacks ‚Äúdoesn't vanish.‚Äù It increases the wealth of billionaires like him. Instead of making the very rich even richer, how about increasing wages for American workers. Is that a bad idea?"
"Today, we have the highest rate of childhood poverty of almost any major nation, our child care system is dysfunctional, our teachers are underpaid and many public schools are struggling. We need to invest in our kids, not a wall with Mexico."
Republicans officials don't push the myth of voter fraud because it is an actual problem. They push it to maintain the racist voting laws that have kept them in power for generations. The real problem we face is voter suppression.
It was a Republican president ‚Äî not Bernie Sanders ‚Äî who first argued for the creation of a progressive estate tax to reduce the enormous concentration of wealth. Mitch McConnell might want to listen.
Congratulations to New Jersey and @GovMurphy for signing a bill today to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour. Now we must ensure a livable wage in all 50 states.
.@SenSchumer and I are here to say: corporations must address the needs of workers before the interests of wealthy stockholders. Our bill will prohibit corporations from buying back stock unless they invest in workers and communities first.
"Instead of wasting billions on a wall with Mexico, tax breaks for billionaires and a bloated military budget, we need to end childhood poverty, rebuild our crumbling infrastructure, combat climate change and invest in our kids and seniors."
"Today on Rosa Parks' 106th birthday we must do more than just remember her lifetime of organizing. We must honor her by working to fulfill her vision of racial, economic and social justice."
"Stacey Abrams is a great choice to deliver the Democratic response. I'm very much looking forward to her speech.

For the third year in a row, following the Democratic rebuttal I'll be on Facebook Live, Twitter and YouTube to respond to Trump."
"Three people own more wealth than the bottom half of our country. 25 hedge fund managers earn twice as much as all 140,000 kindergarten teachers. One family (Kochs) spent $400 million to buy elections. That's why we need a political revolution."
I stand with @transportworker fighting to keep us safe and to keep airline mechanics jobs in America.
"Instead of repealing the estate tax and giving a massive tax cut to the Walton family and Kochs as Mitch McConnell and Trump want to do, let‚Äôs substantially increase this tax on multi-millionaires and billionaires and reduce wealth inequality in America."
"Walmart is spending $20 billion on a share repurchase program.

With a fraction of that amount, Walmart could have raised hourly wages of every employee to $15.

Corporations should address the needs of workers before the interests of wealthy stockholders."
"Catalyst Pharmaceuticals raised the price of a life-saving drug from $0 to $375,000.

Now patients are worried they are going to suffer or even die because of the greed of a drug company.

If Catalyst does not substantially lower the price of this medication, Congress must act."
Let's not kid ourselves. What we have today is a campaign finance system that amounts to legalized bribery.
"Remember when Trump promised that his tax giveaway to the rich would put an extra $4,000 into the pockets of middle-class families?

The reality: bonuses for average workers are up by just two cents an hour since Trump‚Äôs tax plan was signed into law. Two cents."
Every other major country has made the morally principled and financially responsible decision to make health care a right to all of their people. Those who say this goal is unachievable are selling the American people short.
Gov. Northam should resign. Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax should step in and begin a new day for Virginia.
"After 35 days of pain and suffering for federal workers and contractors during the Trump shutdown, what's the first thing that the GOP leadership decides to do? Make the wealthiest families in America even richer."
"Trump‚Äôs withdrawal from the INF treaty is dangerous and irresponsible. We should strengthen these treaties, not end them. We should invest in our children, our seniors and our working families, not in an incredibly expensive arms race."
"The grotesque level of wealth inequality, from a moral, economic and political perspective, is the great challenge we face. We cannot have a vibrant democracy or a just economy when so few have so much, and so many have so little."
"Pharma companies lied about the addictive impacts of opioids, yet not one of them has been held fully accountable for this crisis.

We have got to start punishing their greed and recklessness which is killing tens of thousands of Americans every year."
"Trump and McConnell believe‚Äîat a time of obscene inequality‚Äîthat they need to help out the richest 0.2% of Americans by repealing the estate tax.

I have a better idea: raise the estate tax so that billionaires pay their fair share."
"Under billionaire Eddie Lampert's watch 3,500 Sears stores closed and over 250,000 workers lost their jobs. Lampert must ensure a just transition for Sears workers who lost their jobs due to his greed. Workers deserve severance pay and to have their benefits honored."
"The American people do not want endless war. It is the job of Congress to responsibly end these military interventions and bring our troops home, not to come up with more reasons to continue them."
"According to my Republican colleague, corporations are people who can have unlimited influence in our elections. But if you're a low-income worker in Kentucky, we shouldn't make it any easier for you to vote."
"Our infrastructure is collapsing. Teachers are underpaid. Veterans sleep on the streets. Families can't afford child care.

But, according to my Republican colleagues, one of our highest priorities must be to give hundreds of billions of dollars to a few billionaire families."
It is not just a coincidence that 46% of all new income is going to the top 1%. That is the result of an economy that is rigged in favor of the wealthy.
"I say to Mitch McConnell and Donald Trump: Instead of repealing the estate tax, let‚Äôs substantially increase this tax on multi-millionaires and billionaires and reduce wealth inequality in America."
"The fairest way to reduce wealth inequality, invest in the disappearing middle class and preserve our democracy is to enact a progressive estate tax on the inherited wealth of multi-millionaires and billionaires.

Today I'm introducing a bill to do that:"
"Somehow, we have billions of dollars available for more jails and incarceration, but we ""can't afford"" to provide kids with the college education they need to survive in modern America. That doesn't make any sense to me."
"Billionaires and huge corporations should not be allowed to use loopholes and tax havens to avoid paying their fair share. At a time of massive global inequality the very wealthy should be paying more in taxes, not less."
"When Yemenis see ‚ÄúMade in USA‚Äù on the bombs that are killing them, it tells them that the USA is responsible for this war.

This is not the message we should be sending to the world. Congress must end support for the catastrophic war in Yemen led by a despotic Saudi regime."
"The Saudi-led war in Yemen has been a humanitarian and strategic disaster. 85,000 children have starved to death. Today my colleagues and I are reintroducing our resolution to end U.S. support for this war and reclaim our constitutional authority."
"After Trump shut down the government for 35 days the first bill Sen. McConnell introduced wasn't to provide back-pay to 1.2 million federal contractors.

It wasn't to guarantee health care or lower drug prices.

It was to repeal the estate tax for the 1,700 wealthiest families."
The racist and homophobic attack on Jussie Smollett is a horrific instance of the surging hostility toward minorities around the country. We must come together to eradicate all forms of bigotry and violence.
We have a rigged tax code that has essentially legalized tax-dodging for large corporations and the world's wealthiest individuals. It is time to end these egregious loopholes and make the wealthy pay their fair share.
"Ending the estate tax would give a tax break of up to $63 billion to the Walton family and $39 billion to the Kochs‚Äîbut $0 to 99.8% of Americans.

At a time of record inequality, the very last thing we should do is line the pockets of the rich."
"This billionaire thinks a high marginal tax rate on the rich has never worked in any country, ever. Has he heard of the United States of America?"
"Trump on his tax cuts: ""It‚Äôs gonna be a tremendous thing for the American people. It‚Äôs gonna be fantastic for the economy.""

The reality: A windfall for massive corporations and billionaires. No major impact on job growth or investments in the US economy."
"If we think big, not small, we can end the grotesque level of income and wealth inequality, guarantee health care for all, have a livable minimum wage and make public colleges and universities tuition-free. The struggle continues."
"While I do not support the BDS movement, we must defend every American‚Äôs constitutional right to peacefully engage in political activity. It is clear to me that S.1 would violate Americans‚Äô First Amendment rights."
As a nation we have a choice: are we going to join every other major country and make health care a right? Or will we continue to allow insurance and pharma companies to make huge profits off of people's suffering?
I do not believe that men and women fought and died for our right to vote so that billionaires could buy elections. We must move to real campaign finance reform and public funding of elections.
"Mr. President. 800,000 federal employees and their families are human beings, not your play things. Do not treat them with contempt and disrupt their lives. They have kids. They have needs. Do not shut down the government again."
"Our infrastructure is crumbling. Instead of building a wall on the Mexican border, we should create millions of good-paying jobs rebuilding our roads, bridges, water systems, wastewater plants, schools, airports and affordable housing."
"When an undocumented person commits a murder, Trump talks about it incessantly. When, in 2017,  a white guy like Stephen Paddock kills 58 people in Las Vegas and wounds 851, Trump has very little to say."
"Today, on Holocaust Remembrance Day, we pledge to never forget the 6 million Jews murdered by Hitler. At a time of increased tribalism and  xenophobia, we must recommit ourselves to fight against all forms of bigotry and intolerance."
"Young people all over the world are demanding action on climate change, like @GretaThunberg, who had the courage to demand that the world‚Äôs corporate elite do their part to address this global crisis."
"Read this piece from @NickKristof about Saudi human rights activist Loujain al-Hathloul, who has been detained and tortured by the Saudi regime. The U.S. must push for rights activists to be freed and the regime held accountable."
"At a time of massive wealth and income inequality, when the 3 wealthiest people own more wealth than the bottom half of our country and 46% of all new income goes to the top 1%, Americans want the rich to pay their fair share of taxes."
"‚ÄúWe can decide to fight for real labor law in this country with the fundamental principle that if you go to work you get paid. And you have the right to strike if you are not given that.‚Äù ‚Äì@FlyingWithSara, President of Association of Flight Attendants-CWA"
"Thank you air traffic controllers, flight attendants, federal workers and contract employees for standing up for your rights, holding rallies, organizing and sharing  heartbreaking stories over the past 35 days. You are the reason that the government shutdown finally ended."
"President Trump shut down the government, held 800,000 federal employees hostage and disrupted vital federal services for absolutely nothing. Pathetic!"
"The Constitution and federal law bans indentured servitude. That means no worker, including federal employees, should be forced to work without getting paid. Trump's anti-worker government shutdown is an ugly attack on the working class of this country."
"Mr. President. Your shutdown is not only hurting federal employees and people who need government services, it's now impacting the general public and the whole economy. End your shutdown now. Pay federal workers."
"Today, six Republicans had the courage to stand up to Trump and vote with Democrats to end the shutdown without spending billions on an unneeded wall. 

The ball is now in Mitch McConnell's court. He must stand up to Trump and put federal employees back to work."
"‚ÄúThey‚Äôre using us as a bargaining chip.‚Äù
‚ÄúI feel as, I think many people do, a bit like a pawn.‚Äù
‚ÄúHolding federal employees hostage is not the way to do it.‚Äù

President Trump, listen to federal workers. End the shutdown!"
"The Maduro government has waged a violent crackdown on Venezuelan civil society, violated the constitution by dissolving the National Assembly and was re-elected last year in an election many observers said was fraudulent. The economy is a disaster and millions are migrating. 1/3"
"Once again, it is clear that a majority of Americans support an agenda which calls for economic justice. Increasing the minimum wage to $15 an hour would give a pay raise to 40 million Americans. Let's do it."
"The dangerous Line 3 pipeline in Minnesota would send a million barrels of tar sands oil‚Äîthe dirtiest fossil fuel in the world‚Äîthrough the headwaters of the Mississippi River, tribal treaty lands and sacred wild rice beds. It must be stopped. #StopLine3"
"Trump‚Äôs shutdown is forcing furloughed workers to choose between paying for rent or chemotherapy.

That is not a choice anyone in the wealthiest country in the history of the world should have to make.

Mr. President, stop holding federal employees hostage. End the shutdown now."
"Every two days last year, a multi-millionaire in the world became a billionaire. It's called a rigged global economy and this is how it works."
"Billionaires like Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and Trump may not get it, but It's not complicated. Federal employees go to food banks because they have to feed their kids, and they can't do that without a paycheck. Mr. President. End the shutdown you created."
"President Trump, you want to talk about a crisis? 7 million Americans have become uninsured since you took office. The uninsured rate is the highest in 5 years.

We must end the embarrassment of being the only major country not to guarantee health care for all. #MedicareForAll"
"Trump stated loudly and clearly: ""I am proud to shut down the government."" 

Now, Mr. President, with 800,000 federal employees struggling to pay their bills, end the crisis you created. Pay federal employees. Open the government."
Congratulations to LA teachers for leading this country forward to ensure that all our children get a quality education. When we stand together there is nothing we cannot accomplish.
"The economy is ""booming"" for Trump and his billionaire golfing buddies at Mar-a-Lago, but for the 80 percent of workers who are living paycheck to paycheck, this is not an economy to be proud of."
"If Trump were serious about protecting our national security, he would recognize that climate change is not a ""hoax"" and is already causing destruction and instability worldwide. The time for bold action is now."
"The bad news: We have just 11 years to take bold steps to rapidly transform our energy system to sustainable energy if the planet is going to remain habitable.

The good news: We can revitalize our economy and create tens of millions of jobs in the process."
"Today, 46 years after Roe v. Wade, abortion is a right in name only for millions of women in America. Our job: do everything we can to protect and expand reproductive rights and access to abortion across the country."
Discrimination has no place in our military or society. It is my hope that this temporary ruling will not be the final outcome. We must stand with trans service members. Trump's efforts to divide us will not succeed.
"We must stop incarcerating millions of Americans and funding militarism, and end racism in the criminal justice system and in the voting booth. Our attention should be on lifting up all Americans."
"Trump says he supports the working class. Really? Today, as a result of his cruel government shutdown, 800,000 federal workers worry about how they will feed their kids, pay their mortgages or see a doctor. Mr. President. End the shutdown."
"9 years ago the disastrous Citizens United decision opened the door for billionaires and corporate interests to buy our elections.

To restore our one person, one vote democracy, we must pass a constitutional amendment to overturn Citizens United and stop the slide to oligarchy."
"We have a president who is a racist.

Today we say to Trump: We aren't going back to more bigotry, discrimination and division. We're going forward."
"We must do more than just ‚Äúhonor and remember‚Äù Dr. King. We must be faithful to his revolutionary spirit, his call for a ‚Äúradical revolution of values‚Äù and his incredible courage in taking on virtually the entire political and economic establishment of his time. #MLKDay"
"Trump is shutting down the government not just for his absurd wall. When you don't pay 800,000 federal workers you are destroying the concept of government in a democratic society, and moving to more privatization and corporate control over our lives."
"Interesting. Trump and Putin are not only billionaire, anti-democratic authoritarians but they deny the crisis of climate change and push fossil fuels. What's the connection?"
"It is not a radical idea to say that instead of throwing millions of Americans off of the health care they have, we must join every other major country on Earth and guarantee health care as a right, not a privilege, through a Medicare for All system."
"""When machines and computers, profit motives and property rights are considered more important than people, the giant triplets of racism, materialism and militarism are incapable of being conquered.‚Äù -Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., Riverside Church, 1967"
Mr. President. Stop holding federal employees hostage and stop holding the young people in DACA hostage. End the federal shutdown and reinstate legal status for these young Americans. #NoWall
"No, President Trump, the economy is not ‚Äúabsolutely booming‚Äù when nearly 80 percent of workers live paycheck to paycheck. Instead of an agenda for the wealthy few, we need to create an economy that works for all of us."
"Since Trump was elected, the five richest people in America have seen their wealth go up by over $100 billion.

Over the past year, wages for average workers are up by $9.11 a week after adjusting for inflation.

That is the economic reality under Trump."
"Instead of an austerity program for working families and the poor, we need austerity for billionaires and large multinational corporations."
"President Trump said that ""nobody has been better at the military"" than him.

So why is he keeping the government shut down and leaving 42,000 service members without paychecks for the first time in history?"
"The wealth gap between white Americans and African Americans has more than TRIPLED over the past 50 years.

Today, the median white family has almost 10 times as much wealth as the median black family.

We must fight for racial and economic justice for all."
"If this report is true, Donald Trump committed obstruction of justice‚Äîa felony and a potentially impeachable offense. I am glad that the House will be investigating this serious issue."
"We must repeal the Trump tax breaks for the top 1% and large, profitable corporations. At a time of massive income and wealth inequality, we need to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure and create a sustainable economy, not make the very rich even richer."
"Saudi Arabia's crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, has been hailed as a progressive reformer. But his track record of imprisoning, torturing and murdering activists begs to differ. It's time that the U.S. and the international community hold this despotic regime accountable."
Congratulations to @GovMurphy and the New Jersey state legislature for agreeing to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour. This is a major step forward for economic justice. Our job now: pass $15 minimum wage legislation for ALL Americans.
"Maybe I‚Äôm the ‚Äúradical‚Äù one, but I don‚Äôt think it's acceptable that the top 25 Wall Street hedge fund managers made over $15 billion in compensation in 2017‚Äînearly double what all 140,000 kindergarten teachers in America made last year."
"Over the past 40 years there has been an enormous transfer of income from the middle class to rich. Since 1979, the bottom 90% of Americans have seen their share of national income decline from 58% to just 46%‚Äîcosting them nearly $11,000 per household."
"It is disgraceful that we have a president who is holding hostage the paychecks of 800,000 federal employees all because he didn't like being attacked by Fox News. Mr. President, end this dangerous shutdown now."
"Yesterday Trump‚Äôs nominee to lead the EPA, Andrew Wheeler, wouldn't call climate change a crisis. And in his opening statement, he didn‚Äôt mention the words ""climate change"" once.

We need an administration that leads the world in combatting climate change, not denies this crisis."
"When we raise the minimum wage to a living wage, poverty will go down and new jobs will be created. This a win-win for the economy and our country. It's time to pass a $15 minimum wage."
"We need to change national priorities in this country. Instead of giving a trillion dollars in tax breaks to the top 1 percent and large, profitable corporations, we need to raise the minimum wage to a living wage of $15 an hour."
"Our $15 minimum wage bill would give a raise to over 40 million Americans, including more than half of African American and Latinx workers. A job should lift you out of poverty, not keep you in it. It's time every worker in America is paid a living wage."
"Today, along with Rep. @BobbyScott and 181 House cosponsors and 31 Senate cosponsors, I'm announcing the Raise the Wage Act to bring the federal minimum wage up to $15 an hour.

Watch our announcement live here:"
"Trump thinks we have ""the greatest economy in the history of America."" It may be great for his friends at Mar-a-Lago, but:

-The average worker makes less today than 43 years ago
-80% live paycheck to paycheck
-43% of households can't afford basic needs"
"At a time of massive income and wealth inequality, the wealthiest people in this country must start paying their fair share of taxes. 

And we must do away with the massive loopholes that allow profitable corporations to stash billions of dollars in tax havens overseas."
Racism and white supremacy have no place in Vermont. Kiah Morris was an excellent representative and our state is worse off without her in office. We must root out racism in Vermont and ensure that no one fears for their safety because of the color of their skin.
"On nearly every ""radical"" idea the American people are with us:

72% want to expand Social Security.
70% want Medicare for All.
65% want a jobs guarantee.
64% want to legalize marijuana.
60% want tuition-free public colleges.
58% want $15 min wage.
57% want to break up big banks."
"The scientists tell us that the future of the planet is endangered by climate change. Meanwhile, because of Trump's government shutdown, about 95% of E.P.A. employees have been furloughed because they are ""non-essential."" How insane is that?"
"While labor productivity has more than doubled since the late 1960s, nearly half of all new income generated in the U.S. since 1993 has gone to the top 1 percent.

This is what we mean when we say the economy is rigged in favor of the wealthy."
"Think big, not small. It is not ""radical"" to demand that all Americans receive decent wages, guaranteed health care, quality education, affordable housing and a clean environment. We need a government that represents all of us, not just the 1%."
"We need a revolution in education. Teachers in LA should not be forced to strike for decent wages and smaller classes. All parents deserve high quality, affordable childcare.  Young people should not leave college deeply in debt. We must get our priorities right."
"The time has come to fulfill and expand upon FDR‚Äôs vision that he laid out in 1944.

These are not radical ideas. They're supported by the majority of Americans. Working together, we can and we must achieve economic, social, racial, political and environmental justice for all."
"Trump says the economy is ""booming."" It is‚Äîfor the top 10 CEOs who saw their combined compensation soar by 60% in 2017. 

For the average worker, however, real wages went up by just 1.2% over the past year. 

The very rich get richer. Working families continue to struggle."
"""[The animals] are being taken care of better than we are."" ‚ÄìLarry Howard, a worker at the National Zoo who doesn't know how he is going to pay his bills during Trump's shutdown.

"In America, a woman‚Äînot the government or her employer‚Äîmust control her own body. We must vigorously defend women‚Äôs access to all reproductive health services and allow them to make their own medical decisions."
"Enough is enough.

We are going to end the disgrace of health care being a privilege for the wealthy. We must pass Medicare for all and make health care a right."
"The federal minimum wage of $7.25 is a starvation wage. That is why I, along with many other members of Congress, will introduce legislation this week to raise that wage to $15 an hour. If you work 40 hours a week, you should not live in poverty."
"Mr. President. Do you want to know what a real ""national emergency"" is? The scientists tell us that if we don't combat climate change aggressively, the severe damage done to our country and planet will be irreversible. Now that's a ""crisis."""
"Today, the 3 wealthiest Americans own more wealth than the bottom half of our people, and income and wealth inequality is worse now than at any time since the 1920s. This is a moral outrage and bad economics. Not acceptable."
"There‚Äôs no crisis at the border but Trump‚Äôs shutdown is creating a crisis: The safety of the nation‚Äôs air travel system is at risk, tax refunds might not go out on time, national parks are overflowing with trash and hundreds of thousands of federal employees aren‚Äôt getting paid."
"Things that are national emergencies:
-30 million without health insurance
-15 million children in poverty
-Tens of thousands dying from opioids and gun violence
-Climate change

Things that are not national emergencies:
-Building a border wall to satisfy Fox News"
"Last year, the five largest drug companies in America made nearly $60 billion in profits. The top five pharma CEOs made over $113 million in total compensation in 2017.

Meanwhile, 1 in 5 Americans can‚Äôt afford their prescriptions. That should outrage every member of Congress."
"Air traffic controllers got paychecks for a total of $0 today because of Trump's government shutdown.

This is a crisis!

Mr. Trump, stop holding our federal employees hostage as political pawns. Open the government now."
"In the richest country in the history of the world, Americans should not have to live in fear that they will die because they cannot afford the life-saving medication they need. Pharma's greed is killing Americans and that has got to end. (with @BizHealthPol)"
"Trump has told the American people several hundred times that Mexico would pay for the wall. That is a lie. If his wall were to be built, Mexico would not pay for it. American taxpayers would."
"Why do Americans pay the highest prices for prescription drugs in the world?

Why are there no restrictions on what a drug company can charge?

The answer is simple: other than Wall Street, the pharmaceutical industry is the most powerful political force in the country."
"How many people need to die, how many people need to get unnecessarily sicker before Congress is prepared to take on the greed of the prescription drug industry? 

Today, we are introducing legislation to end the pharmaceutical industry‚Äôs greed and drastically lower drug prices."
"Instead of trying to bring us together as a people, Trump is trying to divide us up. And, in the process, divert our attention away from the real crises facing the working families of this nation."
It gives me no pleasure to tell you what you already know: Trump lies all of the time and his speech last night was no exception.
"""Make no mistake, the Trump shutdown is anti-veteran,"" - This Iraq War Marine Corps veteran @will_c_fischer wants you to know that 31 percent of all federal employees are veterans and Trump is holding many of their paychecks hostage. (With @votevets)"

-Half of older Americans have no retirement savings
-40 million are dealing with outrageous student debt"
"President Trump, We don‚Äôt need to create artificial crises. We have enough real ones. Let us end this shutdown and bring the American people together around an agenda that will improve life for all of our people. #BernieResponds"
"Tonight I will deliver a live response to President Trump's Oval Office address, immediately following Sen. Schumer and Rep. Pelosi's response. Tune in here:"
Democrats must block any legislation that does not reopen the government. It is absolutely absurd that the first Senate legislation during the shutdown is a bill which punishes Americans who exercise their constitutional right to engage in political activity.
"Trump's reckless shutdown is threatening the livelihoods of some 800,000 federal workers. Mr. President: Enough is enough. Federal workers must be paid and the government must reopen."
"97% of Americans support comprehensive background checks. It's time for Republicans in Congress to listen to the American people and stop simply obeying the dictates of the NRA. 

We need to pass common sense gun safety legislation now."
"We do not need to waste billions on an unneeded wall so that Trump can appease right-wing extremists.

We need to create millions of good-paying jobs by rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure ‚Äî roads, bridges, water systems, rail and affordable housing."
"The fight for Medicare for all will be opposed by all of the special interests‚Äîdrug companies, insurance companies, Wall Street‚Äîwho make billions from our dysfunctional health care system.

They may have the money. But we have the people."
"There is no border crisis. The real crisis is that 800,000 people don‚Äôt know how they‚Äôll pay their mortgages, pay student loans, put gas in their cars or put food on the table because of Donald Trump‚Äôs government shutdown."
"As a result of Trump's shutdown, 800,000 federal employees are in danger of not receiving a paycheck.

They're worried about how they'll pay their mortgages, feed their families and put gas in their cars.

Unbelievably, Republican leader Mitch McConnell refuses to take action."
"The U.S. has the world's largest economy. Yet, we lag far behind many other developed countries in health care, life expectancy, infant mortality, poverty, education and infrastructure.  We need a government that works for all, not just the 1%."
"Jimmy Carter was right when he said that America is ""an oligarchy, with unlimited political bribery.""

Every day we are sliding further away from democracy into an oligarchic form of government. 

Democracy should be about one person, one vote‚Äînot billionaires buying elections."
Sen. Van Hollen is absolutely right. We should block consideration of all bills on the Senate floor until we end the Trump shutdown and reopen the federal government.
It‚Äôs absurd that the first bill during the shutdown is legislation which punishes Americans who exercise their constitutional right to engage in political activity. Democrats must block consideration of any bills that don‚Äôt reopen the government. Let's get our priorities right.
"Mr. President, I doubt very much that you can ‚Äúrelate‚Äù to federal workers. 

When is the last time you had to choose between paying your mortgage, feeding your family or putting gas in the car? 

End the shutdown. Pay federal employees."
"As a result of Trump's government shutdown, many federal employees will be unable to pay their mortgages or feed their kids. The Senate's first act must be to re-open the government.  

Leader McConnell: Let the Senate vote on the House bills to re-open the government."
"The business model of Wall Street is fraud. When the 6 largest American banks have $10 trillion in assets, equivalent to 54% of our GDP, it's time to break them up. We need banks which invest in the real economy and create jobs, not rip us off."
"If President Trump is really concerned about national security then why isn't he paying employees at the FBI, TSA and other security agencies who work every day to protect this country? 

President Trump. End your shutdown of the government. Pay federal employees."
"President Trump, federal employees are not billionaires. They have to feed their kids and pay their mortgages. End the shutdown now and treat federal employees with the respect they are due."
"Congratulations to Republican Senators Cory Gardner and Susan Collins for understanding that 800,000 federal employees must be paid. If Leader McConnell allows the Senate to vote, we can end the government shut down now."
"Rep. Liz Cheney, daughter of Dick Cheney, yesterday attacked ""the fraud of socialism."" Really? I wasn't aware that it was ""socialism"" that lied about weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, and got us into a horrific war that we should never have started."
"Is it ""radical"" to demand that all Americans have health care, that billionaires pay their fair share of taxes, that workers earn at least $15 an hour and that we transform our energy system in order to combat climate change? I don't think so."
I want to congratulate the House for holding hearings for the first time on Medicare for all. I‚Äôm confident the results will show that Medicare for all is the way forward if we want to guarantee heath care to all people in a cost-effective way.
"At a time when climate change threatens our planet, when our infrastructure is crumbling, when 30 million people have no health insurance, I'm concerned that the concept of PAYGO will make it harder for Congress to address the many crises facing our working families."
Trump is a pathological liar. How can we develop rational public policy when we have a president who doesn't know the difference between truth and falsehood? Not a good situation for the most powerful nation on Earth.
"Health care is a right, not a privilege. We need Medicare for All so we can end the disgrace of 30 million Americans having no health insurance, and many more being underinsured with high deductibles and co-payments."
"Our job: pursue a bold agenda that transforms our energy system away from fossil fuels to energy efficiency and sustainable energy. 

We're at war with climate change and, for the sake of our kids and grandchildren, we cannot lose."
We must look at climate change as if it were a devastating military attack against the United States and the entire planet. And we must respond accordingly.
"As 2018 comes to an end, Jane and I want to wish all of you a happy New Year's Eve and a healthy and wonderful new year."
"Congratulations to Chuck Todd and Meet the Press for holding a serious discussion about climate change.  Will this be a breakthrough moment for mainstream TV, which rarely discusses this issue?"
"The fossil fuel industry is now the equivalent of the tobacco industry. It creates death and destruction, and then spends billions denying its responsibility.

We must transform our energy system away from fossil fuels and into energy efficiency and sustainable energy."
One of the great crises facing our democracy is power of the billionaire class over our political process. The needs of ordinary people are ignored when the very rich and their Super PACs buy elections. We need to overturn Citizens United and move to public funding of elections.
"If it is just ""bi-partisan politics"" to spend some $700 billion a year on the military, more than the next ten nations combined, why is it a ""radical"" idea to lower student debt and make public colleges and universities tuition-free?"
"The extraordinary power of the corporate establishment is not just over our economy and political life, it is over our imagination and our ability to envision a different kind of world."
"As we enter the new year let us not forget that while the very rich become much richer, millions of Americans are unable to afford health care, housing, prescription drugs or education. In 2019 we can do better. We must do better."
"There will no real social progress in this country unless we have the courage to take on Wall Street, the insurance companies, the drug companies, the military-industrial complex, the fossil fuel industry, the prison industry and all the other forces of greed."
"The six largest banks now have over $10 trillion in assets‚Äî54% of GDP. We must break up these huge financial institutions. If a bank is too big to fail, it is too big to exist."
"As we celebrate Christmas and the holiday season, let us rededicate ourselves to a world of peace - and economic, social, racial and environmental justice."
Jane and I want to take this opportunity to wish everyone a very Merry Christmas and a happy holiday season.
"While Trump talks about a ""booming economy,"" the reality for working families is:
-Real wages for average workers are lower than in 1973
-80% live paycheck to paycheck
-Half of older Americans have no retirement savings
New Year‚Äôs Resolution: Create an economy that works for all."
"Today, over 40 million Americans live in poverty - including millions of children and seniors.  As we enter the holiday season, and think about the future of our country, let us not forget the biblical admonishment: ""Do unto others as you would have them do unto you."""
"Wealth inequality is a profound moral issue this country must address. The richest 3 Americans cannot continue owning more wealth than the bottom half of our country, while over 40% cannot afford the basics to live."
"We must end the growing concentration of ownership in agribusiness and fight to preserve and strengthen family based agriculture. The American people deserve high quality, locally grown food."
"This is what Christmas season looks like in Trumpland:
-Take away paychecks of 800,000 workers by shutting the government.
-Take away $1.40 meals from 755,000 hungry, unemployed Americans.
- Give Pfizer a $26.5 billion tax cut after it increased the price of life saving drugs."
This president‚Äôs erratic and impulsive behavior is a danger to our country and a major impediment in terms of addressing the crises we face. His decision to shut down the government is just the latest example of this destructive pattern.
"Think about it for a minute.

Democrats and Republicans come together, after a whole lot of debate, and agree on how to keep the government open.

And then, after a day of right-wing media criticism, the president undermines all of that. To say the least, that is problematic."
Trump's decision to shut down the government is just the latest example of a destructive pattern. The time is long overdue for congressional Republicans to stand up to him.
"""I am proud to shut down the government...  I will take the mantle. I will be the one to shut it down. I‚Äôm not going to blame you for it."" ‚Äì@realDonaldTrump, last Tuesday"
"If Trump shuts the federal government down, should federal employees be available to escort him to his beachfront resort in Florida for a 16-day holiday? I don‚Äôt think so!"
"This is what happened:

1) The Senate unanimously voted to keep the government open
2) The House was ready to pass the bill
3) Rush and Fox &amp; Friends criticized Trump
4) Trump now wants to shut down the government, putting 800,000 people out of work the week before Christmas"
"Last Tuesday, Trump said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm proud to shut down the government.‚Äù And he did. Despite unanimous Republican support in the Senate and overwhelming Republican support in the House, Trump will leave 800,000 federal employees without paychecks. How‚Äôs that for a holiday gift?"
"Trump, the ‚Äúgreat friend‚Äù of American workers, is now prepared to ignore the unanimous U.S. Senate bill to fund the government.

While Trump heads off to his exclusive golf club in Florida, his Christmas gift to some 800,000 federal employees is to deny them their paychecks."
"85,000 children have already starved to death as a result of the Saudi-led intervention in Yemen.

Millions more face the prospect of famine and death.

The U.S. should be doing everything we can to support the ceasefire, not undermining it. Disgusting!"
"Let‚Äôs be absolutely clear about what Trump is doing with his latest food stamps work requirements rule: he is attacking the poor.

We should be expanding programs like food stamps that lift people out of poverty, not making them even harder to access."
"There's no greater disservice to our veterans than to deny them the VA health care they've earned by draining the VA of its resources in order to line the pockets of corporate CEOs. 

If Trump thinks privatizing the VA is what's best for our veterans, he is dead wrong."
"Nearly half of American adults have had an immediate family member incarcerated at some point. HALF.

Imagine what we could accomplish if we invested in jobs and education instead of paying $80 billion a year to lock up 2.2 million people."
"Medicare for All is not a crazy idea.

What's crazy is that our health care system is designed to make as much profit for insurance and pharma executives as possible, while ordinary people die because they can't afford the care and medicine they need."
"I'm glad the First Step Act passed. But there is much more needed to achieve comprehensive criminal justice reform. We must:

-End cash bail
-End private prisons
-End mandatory minimums
-Reinstate the federal parole system

Our primary goal must be rehabilitation, not punishment."
"Trump promised that his tax giveaway to the wealthy would put an extra $4,000 into the pockets of middle-class families.

He lied. Bonuses are up $0.02/hr since the GOP tax cuts passed.

Our job: Repeal Trump‚Äôs tax breaks for the wealthy and rebuild the disappearing middle class."
"What I want to know is: if Sears has $25 million to give bonuses to executives, why is the company telling laid off employees they don't have the money to pay their severance?"
"U.S. student loan debt outstanding reached a record $1.465 trillion last month.

You know the most revolting part of this crisis?

The federal government makes billions in profits off of student loans each year."
Happy National Maple Syrup Day! Vermont is the biggest producer of maple syrup in America‚Äîproducing nearly 2 million gallons of maple syrup last year alone. That's a lot of syrup.
We must do everything we can to protect our democracy and work with allies to do the same.
"This is an outrageous, disastrous decision that threatens the health care and lives of millions of people. It must be overturned.

We must move forward to make health care a right for every American."
"""You say you love your children above all else, yet you are stealing their futures right before their very eyes,"" - This 15-year-old activist @GretaThunberg just called out world leaders for their global inaction on climate change."
"Today Gov. Scott Walker signed disgraceful, undemocratic legislation to limit the power of incoming Democratic officials in Wisconsin. Republicans like him across the country are attacking democracy and their power grabs must be stopped."
"It's not just the Saudi-led war in Yemen or the brutal and cold-blooded murder of Jamal Khashoggi. It's the entire structure of the despotic Saudi regime.

The time is long overdue for the U.S. to rethink its relationship with Saudi Arabia."
This is an historic day. For the first time in 45 years the U.S. Senate came together to end an unauthorized war. We have woken up the Congress to its constitutional responsibility. This is the beginning of a new day.
Today we have brought Republicans and Democrats together in a very historic moment to take back the Congress' constitutional responsibility on matters of war.
"What the Senate did today is say that the United States Congress is sick and tired of abdicating its constitutional responsibility on matters of war.

We will not continue to have our military posture dictated by a despotic, murderous regime in Saudi Arabia."
HISTORIC VICTORY: The Senate has voted to stop U.S. military support for the Saudi-led coalition fighting in Yemen. This is the first time ever that the Senate has voted to end an unauthorized war.
It is time for the United States Congress to tell the despotic government of Saudi Arabia that we do not intend to follow their lead in their military adventurism. Speaking live now:
"Everyone needs to see this to understand the consequences of today's Senate vote to end U.S. support for the war in Yemen.

85,000 kids have starved to death.
14 million Yemenis are on the brink of starvation. 

The Senate must end our involvement in this humanitarian disaster."
This Fox News judge does a great job explaining why President Trump is in real trouble.
The people of Denmark are some of the happiest on earth. I met with @DanJoergensen of Denmark's Social Democratic Party (@Spolitik) to learn why.
"For the first time, the Senate will vote today on ending an unauthorized war. 

14 million people in Yemen are on the brink of starvation. 85,000 kids have starved to death.

The U.S. must stop supporting this disastrous Saudi-led war."
"""I don't look at a recession as a bad thing."" - Jamie Dimon, the CEO of JP Morgan Chase (one of the big banks that crashed the economy 10 years ago)."
"Let us show the world today that the U.S. Senate recognizes that real American power does not come from our ability to blow things up, but from our ability to bring people together.

We must finally end US support for the disastrous Saudi-led war in Yemen."
"The eyes of the world are watching the Senate today. Shortly, we will vote to end U.S. support for the disastrous Saudi-led war in Yemen. Watch my speech here:"
"Today the U.S. Senate will vote on whether to end US support for the devastating Saudi-led war in Yemen. 

This would be the first time ever that the Senate has voted to end an unauthorized war. 

We must finally end US involvement in this humanitarian and strategic disaster."
Tomorrow I'll move to proceed to the resolution I've offered with @SenMikeLee and @ChrisMurphyCT to end US involvement in the Saudi-led war in Yemen. I am optimistic that a bipartisan coalition will vote to make clear we will no longer support Saudi Arabia in its destructive war.
Spread the word: Saturday is the last day of open enrollment to sign up for health insurance. Go to  to choose a plan and get covered.
"1 out of 5 Americans cannot afford the medication they need.

Pharmaceutical executives must be held accountable for the massive price-fixing scheme they have concocted to jack up the price of life-saving prescription drugs."
"The bad news: our president doesn't believe in science.

The good news: today 1,000 young people stood up to demand that Congress take on the fossil fuel industry and transform our energy system to sustainable energy.

We're going to win this fight for our people and planet."
People 65 and older must have pretty good health insurance ü§î
"Sears wants to give its executives $25 million in bonuses after closing over 100 stores and laying off thousands of employees. My friends, this is what a rigged economy is all about. (with @riseupretail)"
"This report from Yemen states it clearly‚ÄîU.S. tax dollars are being used to starve children in Yemen. Next week the Senate will vote on SJ Res 54, and tell the president and the world that the U.S. must no longer be complicit in this humanitarian disaster."
"I look forward to an up-or-down vote next week to end U.S involvement in the disastrous Saudi-led war in Yemen. I am confident that we have the bipartisan votes to pass the War Powers resolution in the Senate, which would be an historic step forward."
This Republican mayor leads the first city in Texas powered by 100% renewable energy. Addressing climate change and creating millions of good-paying jobs in the process should not be a partisan issue.
What's it like fleeing a wildfire? Listen to this nurse describe how she and her team narrowly escaped California's recent climate change-fueled disasters.
Walmart is the poster child of corporate greed in America today. We must demand that they pay a living wage.
It is really a disgrace that the major TV networks constantly ignore climate change or give climate deniers a platform. That is exactly why I brought together some of the greatest climate experts in the world to do what the mainstream media won't do.
"12 million people in Yemen are suffering from severe hunger and 85,000 kids have already died from starvation as a result of the Saudi-led war.

The United States should not be supporting Saudi Arabia in this disastrous war. The U.S. Senate must vote to end our involvement."
Antroinette's daughter Antavia died because she had to ration her insulin‚Äîsomething that should never happen again in the wealthiest country in the world. Pharma's greed is literally killing people in this country and they must be stopped.
"This Californian saw the effect of the disastrous wildfires firsthand. If we don't get our act together to boldly address climate change, this is going to be the new normal."
"Thank you to the many, many people who attended and watched our groundbreaking Solving Our Climate Crisis town hall last night, as well as our terrific panelists.

"Some argue that the US is not really engaged in hostilities in Yemen. But as these Yemeni human rights activists told me recently, when Yemenis see ""Made in USA"" on the bombs killing their children, it‚Äôs very clear that the US is part of this war. This must end."
"Our job is to be bold. Our job is to think very big and to go forward in a moral struggle that says: we will protect our planet, not just for our own children but for all the children of the world. #ClimateTownHall"

The Trump tax scam was a fraud from the start and Republicans are now paying the price.
"For the first time, the U.S. Senate just voted to advance a resolution withdrawing U.S. Armed Forces from an unauthorized and unconstitutional war. 

Let us bring this catastrophic war in Yemen to an end, and help bring peace and humanitarian aid to this tortured country."
The Senate is voting on whether to move forward with my resolution to end U.S. support for the horrific Saudi-led war in Yemen. Watch here:
"Amal Hussain died recently in Yemen. She was 7 years old. 

She is one of 85,000 children who have starved to death as a result of the catastrophic Saudi-led war in Yemen. 

The Senate has an opportunity today to end U.S. support for Saudi Arabia's destructive foreign policy."
"Do not forget: it was a U.S. bomb that killed 40 children on a school bus in Yemen in August‚Äîsome of the many thousands of civilians who have died in this horrific, Saudi-led war.

The Senate must vote today to end our support for these atrocities."
"This American woman experienced what it's like to have universal health care in the UK, and now she doesn't want to move back to the United States. (with @t1international)"
Listen to this Fox News pundit condemn the tear gassing of women and children.
"The United States should not be supporting a catastrophic war led by a despotic regime with a dangerous and irresponsible military policy. 

The Senate must vote to end U.S. support for the unconstitutional Saudi-led war in Yemen."
"At a time when voting rights are under grave attack, there is absolutely no place on the federal bench for Thomas Farr, who both authored and defended tactics designed to suppress minority voters. I strongly oppose his nomination."
The United States should not be partnering in Saudi Arabia's disastrous military adventurism. The Senate can stand up this week and take an important step toward ending the brutal and unauthorized war in Yemen.
"The Saudi-led intervention in Yemen, with U.S. support, has killed thousands of civilians. Over 85,000 children have died of starvation.

Enough is enough. The Senate must vote to end U.S. support for this war."
"We should be the ones pushing hardest for a ceasefire in Yemen, not standing in the way of one. The Senate must vote to end US military support for this catastrophe, so we can focus on humanitarian aid and a diplomatic solution."
"This week I will go to the floor of the Senate to try to stop a war that has led to the deaths of many thousands of civilians, mass starvation and one of the greatest humanitarian crises in the world.

The US Senate must vote to end our role in Saudi Arabia‚Äôs war in Yemen."
"The fact that we have a President of the United States who doesn't believe in science is an international embarrassment and incredibly dangerous.

Climate change is already causing devastating consequences. We need bold action, not denials."
"Walmart workers are sick and tired of working for starvation wages. I say to the Walton family of Walmart, do what's right and pay your workers a living wage. (with @UFCW)"
We will hold a live streamed town hall Monday Dec. 3 at 7 PM to discuss the crisis of climate change and how we solve it. More info here:
"Pharmaceutical corporate greed is literally killing people who cannot afford their medication. Together, we can change that. @SSWorks"
On Monday Dec. 3 we‚Äôre holding a national town hall on addressing the crisis of climate change and creating tens of millions of jobs in the process. I hope you‚Äôll join us.
"Walmart insists it can't afford to pay workers $15/hr. Really? The Walton family, which owns Walmart, is the richest family in America‚Äîworth around $167 billion.

Walmart: do the right thing. Raise your minimum wage to a living wage of $15/hr. #BlackFriday"
"With a sense of urgency, Democrats must have the courage to take on powerful special interests and fight for a progressive agenda that addresses the needs of working families."
"85,000 children have starved to death during the Saudi-led intervention in Yemen.

The U.S. should not be part of Saudi Arabia's destructive foreign policy. Congress must end our participation in that war now, and help provide immediate humanitarian aid there to save lives."
President Trump is dead wrong if he believes the solution to the Postal Service's problems is to privatize it. I stand with the Postal Workers fighting to save and strengthen the Postal Service.

"Today President Trump, in a rambling and dishonest statement, tried to defend the despotic Saudi regime and cast doubt on the CIA‚Äôs conclusion that the crown prince was personally involved in the murder of Jamal Khashoggi."
"Nobody said it would be easy to take on the drug and insurance companies and special interests who make billions from our dysfunctional health care system. 

But we will win this struggle for Medicare for All because the American people understand that health care is a right."
"Congratulations to the Toys R Us workers who organized and stood up to Wall Street to fight for the severance pay they deserved. We will continue to fight the greed of Wall Street and private equity, and to expand the collective bargaining rights of all Americans."
"No other country allows pharma companies to charge any price they want for any reason they want. That has to change.

At the start of the new Congress @RepRoKhanna and I will introduce legislation to stop Big Pharma from ripping off the American people."
"At a time of massive corporate profits, and an already regressive tax system, Amazon and other large corporations do not need corporate welfare. Instead, they need to pay their fair share of taxes."
We're holding a major town hall on Dec. 3 to talk about one of the most pressing global crises facing us today: climate change. Will you be tuning in?
"On Monday, Dec. 3 at 7 p.m. we're holding a national town hall on climate change, an issue that does not get nearly enough attention in the mainstream media. Let's go forward to protect the planet and create millions of good-paying jobs."
"The CIA has confirmed what was obvious, that Jamal Khashoggi was murdered at the direction of the Saudi crown prince. The United States must thoroughly reevaluate our relationship with the brutal Saudi dictatorship, and start by ending support for the catastrophic war in Yemen."
Have your prescriptions shot up in price? Are you splitting pills in half to make your prescriptions last longer? Have you had to stop taking medicine altogether in order to pay other bills? Tell Bernie your story.
I say to the Walton family of Walmart: The American people are sick and tired of subsidizing your greed. Get off of welfare and pay your workers a living wage.
The brutal murder of Jamal Khashoggi by Saudi agents demands that we make clear that United States support for Saudi Arabia is not unconditional. It‚Äôs time to stop the war in Yemen.
"Today I met with courageous activists @ralmutawakel and @ralfaqih from Yemeni human rights group @mwatanaen. They talked about the crisis in Yemen, and how important it is to end U.S. support for this disastrous war."
"It is grossly unfair for millions of workers in this country to be earning starvation wages, while the companies they work for make billions in profits and pay their CEOs outrageously high compensation packages."
"The bill I'm introducing today would prohibit large corporations from buying back stock unless they:

-Pay all employees at least $15/hr
-Allow employees to earn up to 7 days of paid sick leave
-Ensure CEO compensation is not more than 150x median employee pay

#StopWALMART"
"The Walton family of Walmart is the wealthiest family in America, worth $180 billion. Middle class taxpayers should not have to subsidize Walmart‚Äôs horrendously low wages to the tune of at least $6.2 billion every year."
"While Walmart claims it cannot afford to pay its workers $15 an hour, it was able to find enough money to pay its CEO more than $22 million last year.

Tomorrow @RepRoKhanna and I will be introducing The Stop WALMART Act to put an end to their outrageous greed."
"Here is the simple truth:

We have a president who is a racist.
A president who is a sexist.
A president who is a homophobe.
A president who is a xenophobe.
And a president who is a religious bigot.

We have got to confront that truth and reject Trump's bigotry."
"The Walton family of Walmart owns more wealth than the bottom 40% of Americans.

Meanwhile 55% of Walmart‚Äôs associates are food insecure.

This is what we mean when we talk about a rigged economy, and why I'm introducing a bill tomorrow to make Walmart start paying a living wage."
Do you want to know why you're being ripped off every day by drug companies? Maybe it's because there are two Big Pharma lobbyists for every member of Congress.
"Trump describes the free media as an ""enemy of the people""; attacks leaders of democratic countries while cozying up to authoritarian nations; and now uses his influence to try to stop the counting of votes in FL and GA.

There is only one way to describe him: Authoritarian."
"Last year, 4 members of the Walton family of Walmart made $12.7 billion in 1 day.

It would take a full-time Walmart worker making $11/hr over 653,000 years to make that much.

Thursday, @RepRoKhanna and I are introducing legislation to make Walmart pay its workers a living wage."
"On days like this we are reminded of the sacrifices made by all those women and men who have worn the uniform in defense of our nation. We owe our veterans a tremendous debt of gratitude, which we will never truly be able to repay."
In the first week of the new Congress I will be re-introducing my legislation to raise the federal minimum wage from $7.25 to $15 an hour. We have got to end starvation wages in the richest country in the world.
"This is a positive step. US participation is unauthorized, unconstitutional and must end completely. I will soon bring SJ Res 54 back to the floor, so the Senate can end US participation in the Yemen war as a matter of law, not simply as a matter of the president‚Äôs discretion."

"Congress must pass legislation to protect Special Counsel Mueller‚Äôs investigation, demand that Acting AG Whitaker recuse himself from overseeing the probe based on his previous statements and only confirm a new attorney general who vows to protect Mueller's investigation."
President Trump must allow Special Counsel Robert Mueller‚Äôs investigation to continue unimpeded. Any attempt by the president or the Justice Department to interfere with Mueller‚Äôs probe would be an obstruction of justice and impeachable offense.
"The Republican agenda is clear.

Our plan: make health care a right to all. Stop giving tax breaks to billionaires. Protect and expand Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. Transition to sustainable energy and leave behind a livable planet for our children."
"It‚Äôs good to see the Trump administration finally admit what some of us have been saying for a long time: the disastrous war in Yemen must end. 

Next month the Senate will have the chance to show we are serious about ending US support for this war by voting on SJ Res 54."
"Brazil‚Äôs new President Jair Bolsonaro is a far-right authoritarian who has praised the former military dictatorship and referred to black activists as ‚Äúanimals.‚Äù

It's very troubling that Bolton sees Bolsonaro as ‚Äúlike-minded‚Äù with Trump. Even more troubling, he‚Äôs probably right."
A reminder from Fox News about the migrant caravan
"Donald Trump Lies, Episode 5,541: Prescription Drugs"
Today we observe #LatinaEqualPay Day because Latina women still make only 53 cents on the dollar compared to white men. It should not be a radical idea to address that issue of basic equality.
"The Republican agenda is clear:

1) Take health care away from 32 million Americans
2) Give huge tax cuts to billionaires and large, profitable corporations
3) Slash Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security
4) Allow the planet to be destroyed"
"Donald Trump and his advisers believe in huge tax breaks for billionaires, but when it comes to raising wages for workers they actually want to abolish the minimum wage. 

Too many Americans are forced to work 2 or 3 jobs to survive. We must raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour."
"If not for Republicans' ""fiscally responsible"" policies, we would have run a $156 billion surplus this year."
"American Airlines made $1.9 billion in profits last year, but many of its workers are forced to rely on food stamps to survive. It's time for American Airlines to offer its Envoy Air workers a new contract that pays them a living wage."
"Three people own more wealth than the bottom 50% of Americans. This is what a rigged economy is all about and why we are fighting for a government and economy that works for ALL people, not just Jeff Bezos, Bill Gates and Warren Buffett."
"A worker making the federal minimum wage needs to work 99 hours a week, 52 weeks a year just to afford a modest one-bedroom apartment 

That is a national disgrace."
"American Airlines made $1.9 billion in profits last year, but many of its workers are forced to rely on food stamps to survive. 

Its time for American Airlines to offer its Envoy Air workers a new contract that pays them a living wage."
"The wealth of the Walton family, the owners of Walmart, increased more than 9,000% since 1982.

Walmart still doesn‚Äôt pay their workers a living wage.

This is what a rigged economy is all about."

"If this country stands for anything it has got to stand for the right of people to practice their religion, to live their lives without bigotry, without fear and certainly within their houses of worship."
The brutal murder of Mr. Khashoggi demands that we make clear that United States support for Saudi Arabia is not unconditional.
"The murder of Jamal Khashoggi is part of an alarming trend with Saudi Arabia. The United States must stand for human rights everywhere, and make clear to the Saudis that this includes their country too."
"The news about bombing attempts against President Obama, Secretary Clinton, George Soros, CNN, various Democratic officials and others is gravely disturbing. While many more details will come to light, these deeply un-American acts of violence have no place in our democracy."
Congratulations to Donald Trump for unintentionally making the case for Medicare for All.
Ending support for the Saudi war in Yemen is exactly what my colleagues and I tried to do earlier this year with SJ Res 54. Next month we will bring it back to the floor for another vote.
Too many Americans have fought and died to defend democracy. We cannot have a president who applauds a murdering despot as a ‚Äòstrong person‚Äô who ‚Äòtruly loves his country.‚Äô
"The Sears bankruptcy is yet another example that our economy is rigged for a powerful few at the top. Vulture capitalists have hollowed out a company to line their own pockets. It's time to build an economy that works for all of us, not just the 1%."
"By attacking the media and condoning violent behavior toward journalists, Trump is giving a green light to authoritarians all over the world to endanger the lives of those who work for a free press."
"We cannot have an ally who murders a dissident in cold blood, in their own consulate. That is unacceptable by any government, but especially by one so closely aligned with the United States."
The debate over climate change in Washington really has nothing to do with science. It has everything to do with campaign contributions.
"The crisis we face as a country is not because of voter fraud. It is because of voter suppression. If Republicans must intimidate and disenfranchise voters in order to win, then they should not be running for office in the first place."
The president makes it more and more clear with every authoritarian he meets that he not only admires them but wants to follow their lead.
I have long been troubled by the nature of the relationship between the U.S. and Saudi Arabia. It's time for us to thoroughly reevaluate that relationship.
Shameful.
"Did you know we once had a Republican president who expanded Social Security? Maybe today's Republicans should listen to what he had to say about the program, instead of trying to destroy it."
"While other states are making it harder to vote, I‚Äôm proud that Vermont is leading the nation by making it easier to participate in the political process. If we believe in a vibrant democracy, we need to have the highest voter turnout in the world."
"Trump's top economic advisor just dismissed a devastating climate change report from the United Nations. What Trump, his administration and his fossil fuel executive friends are doing to the planet is criminal."
"Another pipeline exploded, this time in British Columbia. And yet another community is now in danger. We must imediately transition away from fossil fuels to renewable energy."
"Mitch McConnell wants to cut Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid to pay for Republicans' massive giveaway to the rich and large corporations. 

Enough!

The American people must stand up and make clear to McConnell that we will expand, not cut, programs working people rely on."
"Of the many issues with Trump, his movement to an authoritarian type society here in American and his support for authoritarians around the world should be of concern to every American who believes in democracy."
"Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs crazy: throwing 32 million Americans off health insurance and cutting Medicare by $500 billion.

That‚Äôs Trump‚Äôs plan.

We have a better idea: Improve Medicare for seniors by providing dental, vision and hearing aids ‚Äì and expand it to guarantee health care for all."
"If your plan to get elected is to suppress as many minority voters, young voters, and voters with disabilities as possible, it's pretty clear you shouldn't be in politics in the first place."
"4 Republican policies led to a $779 billion deficit in 2018:

- Bush Tax Cuts: $488 B
- Trump Tax Cuts: $164 B
- Wars in Iraq and Afghanistan: $127 B
- Defense increases since 9/11: $156 B

Without tax cuts for the wealthy and endless wars we would've had a $156 billion SURPLUS."
"Trump doesn't believe that universal health care works anywhere in the world. He should listen to what he said about Canada, Scotland and Australia. Every other major country on earth does it. Stop lying Mr. President."
The Saudi-led war in Yemen has become the world's largest humanitarian disaster. The recent disappearance and likely assassination of Jamal Khashoggi only underscores how urgent it has become for the United States to redefine our relationship with Saudi Arabia.
"In Georgia, in order to try to win the election, cowardly Republicans are blatantly suppressing the vote and denying many African Americans the right to vote. Every American, no matter their political view, must vigorously protest this outrageous action."
"Find out what happened to Jamal Khashoggi and holding the perpetrators accountable is more important than defense contractor profits. 

The time is long overdue for us to reevaluate the US-Saudi relationship and ask whether it's actually advancing our interests and values."
Election Day must become a national holiday. In America we should be celebrating our democracy and doing everything possible to make it easier for people to participate in the political process.
"Anyone who tries to suppress the vote is simply a coward. If you can't win an election based on your ideas, then get the hell out of politics."
Trump lied 19 times about Medicare for all in half an op-ed. How is that even possible?
"Dwight D. Eisenhower was not a radical socialist, he was a Republican. And he tried to warn us about the ""military industrial complex."""
"Given the president‚Äôs propensity to lie about almost everything, it is not surprising that Trump is grossly distorting what my Medicare for All legislation does.

My response to his disastrous op-ed yesterday:"
This is very good news. We can't properly reform our broken criminal justice system without ending the death penalty. We must abolish the death penalty once and for all.
"Our job is to break up the largest financial institutions in the country, not reward their greed, recklessness and illegal behavior which nearly destroyed our economy."
"If the Saudi regime murdered Jamal Khashoggi, a journalist critic, in their own consulate, there must be accountability and an unequivocal condemnation by the United States."
Republicans in Congress want the American people to believe that their tax scam was passed to benefit the middle class. But we know the truth: it was just a payoff to their donors.
As a nation we must fix our broken health care system and give mental and behavioral health care the attention and resources they deserve. #WorldMentalHealthDay
"Not only are the Koch brothers and other Republican billionaires trying to buy elections, Republican officials are actively working to suppress the vote. How cowardly is that! We need universal voter registration in this country."
"Not only is Trump lying about Medicare for All. This president, who fought to throw 32 million Americans off of health insurance, is acting like he cares about health care for seniors or anyone else."
Does single-payer health care mean ‚Äúgovernment-run‚Äù health care? This Canadian doctor breaks down the myth. #MedicareForAll
"Donald Trump, who has a very difficult time telling the truth about anything, is lying about Medicare for All. 

Our proposal wouldn't cut benefits for seniors. In fact, we expand benefits, eliminate deductibles and copays and lower the cost of prescription drugs."
"Donald Trump led the effort to throw 32 million Americans off of health care and proposed massive cuts to Medicaid, Medicare and Social Security, so it should come as no surprise that he is opposed to our effort to guarantee health care for all Americans."
"At a time when 44 million Americans have $1.5 trillion in student debt, Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos has invested millions in companies that take advantage of kids trying to get a higher education."

Listen to this former Wall Street banker explain how the big banks can crash our economy again if we don't break them up.
Millions of Americans like Mario who want to organize unions are unable to do so because of the coercive and often illegal behavior of their employers. That has got to stop.

"The world spends a total of $1.7 trillion a year on the military.

Let me say this to all the survivors out there: I hear you. I believe you. Thank you for speaking out.
"Trump‚Äôs remarks last night were unusually horrendous. 

Dr. Ford has received death threats. Nazis have protested outside her house. Last week, she was forced to publicly answer questions about an experience so painful it still haunts her.

"If @ChuckGrassley and Senate Republicans are concerned a thorough FBI investigation would delay this confirmation process, remember that you refused to allow the Senate to consider Merrick Garland‚Äôs nomination for nearly a year."
"Lying to Congress is a federal crime.

The FBI must examine the veracity of Kavanaugh‚Äôs statements under oath in addition to the sexual assault allegations against him. Kavanaugh's truthfulness with the Senate goes to the very heart of whether he should be confirmed to the court."

Brett Kavanaugh lied repeatedly to the Senate Judiciary Committee. He does not belong on the Supreme Court.
A man who uses the same hostile and aggressive tactics as Donald Trump when faced with credible allegations of sexual assault does not deserve a lifetime seat on the Supreme Court.
"I listened to Dr. Ford and Judge Kavanaugh. I believe Dr. Ford. 

Brett Kavanaugh does not belong on the Supreme Court.

If Judge Kavanaugh wants to clear his name of these serious charges he should demand an FBI investigation. If not, the Senate must reject his nomination."
.@SenatorDurbin asked Judge Kavanaugh if he would support an FBI investigation to clear his name. He refused to answer.
"Senator Dick Durbin: ""With what degree of certainty do you believe Brett Kavanaugh assaulted you?""

Dr. Christine Blasey Ford: ""100 percent."""
We should not be attacking and disparaging the women who have come forward with serious allegations against Judge Kavanaugh. Trump's comments are disgusting.
"Today we need to remember: Dr. Christine Blasey Ford and the others who have come forward have done so with incredible courage, fully knowing that their character would be attacked and terrible things said about them. Their lives will never be the same. We owe them our respect."
"If President Trump is afraid of what an FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh will confirm or uncover, then the nomination should be withdrawn."
Trump and Judge Kavanaugh have two options. Trump can withdraw Judge Kavanaugh's nomination. Or Kavanaugh himself can call for an FBI investigation if he truly believes the allegations are false.
"We pay, by far, the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs. Here's why."
For far too many people it's too difficult to get to the polls. We need to make it much easier for everyone to participate in the democratic process. Election Day should be a national holiday.

I sat down with my friend @SarahKSilverman to explain what democratic socialism means to me. Watch the full interview here:
"Donald Trump claims Democrats want to ""destroy your Social Security.‚Äù 

Surprise! He's lying. 

His own economic advisor just admitted the Trump administration is looking at cutting Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid next year."
"While 1 in 5 seniors are scraping by on less than $13,500/year, our job is not to cut Social Security. Our job: expand Social Security so that every American can retire with dignity, and every person with a disability can live with the security they need."

We are with everyone who is being hit by Hurricane Florence. We are one nation and our job is to stand together and help each other out when disasters hit.
The allegation from Professor Christine Blasey Ford is a serious one that deserves a full investigation. Neither the Judiciary Committee nor the full Senate should vote on Brett Kavanaugh‚Äôs nomination to the Supreme Court until that takes place.
"While Trump and Paul Ryan continue their attempts to destroy Social Security, 150 of my colleagues and I launched the Expand Social Security Caucus yesterday to make sure seniors can retire in dignity."
Workers have a constitutional right to form a union and negotiate for better wages and working conditions. But what we are seeing all over the country is profitable corporations like Delta doing everything they can to prevent that.
"We are far, far past the point of arguing about whether climate change is real. Our job now: do everything we can to protect people from the disasters to come, and work relentlessly to transform our energy system away from fossil fuels."

Mr. President, try working with the people of Puerto Rico for a change, not against them."

"In order to effectively combat the rise of the international authoritarian axis, we need an international progressive movement that mobilizes behind a vision of shared prosperity, security and dignity for all people."
"The Archbishop of Canterbury is right. It is unacceptable that companies like Amazon pay workers wages so low that they have to rely on government programs just to survive, while paying nothing in federal income taxes."
"One year ago, we introduced #MedicareForAll to guarantee health care to everyone.

"There are five times as many kids in child detention centers now than there were a year ago.

Let me repeat that. There are FIVE TIMES as many children locked up and separated from their families than at this time last year."
"While the country is bracing for a massive hurricane, the last thing Trump should be doing is attacking the mayor of San Juan, Carmen Yul√≠n Cruz, who fought for the people of Puerto Rico after the destruction of Hurricane Maria while he played golf with his billionaire friends."
"This is outrageous. The Saudi-led war on Yemen is killing thousands of people, including a school bus full of children last month. America's role should not simply be to help our Saudi clients manage the slaughter more responsibly; we need to stop supporting it altogether."
"Trump tweeted this morning he did a ""great job"" handling the hurricane crisis in Puerto Rico. Meanwhile, new estimates put the Hurricane Maria death toll at nearly 3,000. What a disgrace."
"Today while we remember the lives lost on 9/11, we must also honor the courageous men and women who continue to serve and die in Afghanistan, Iraq and many other places, and consider whether these wars‚Äîthe longest in our history‚Äîhave made us safer."

But when it comes to giving tax breaks to billionaires and corporations, the sky is the limit!"
"Nearly 3,000 people died. 

That is not a ‚Äúsuccess.‚Äù That is a tragedy and a disgrace."
Crystal Mason is going to prison for voting. The voter suppression in this country is out of control.

Answer: our health care system is built to make corporate profits ‚Äî not give people the care they need. #MedicareForAll"
"Methane is a greenhouse gas 86 TIMES more powerful than carbon dioxide at trapping heat in the atmosphere.

President Trump is apparently comfortable with the destruction of our planet if it means he can hand favors to fossil fuel industry billionaires."
"Today we remember the nearly 3,000 lives lost on 9/11 and many brave people who risked their lives that day to help. Those acts of selfless sacrifice speak to the very best of us as a nation‚Äîwe are a people prepared to come together and work for the good of our fellow Americans."
Congratulations to everyone in California who successfully pushed for this incredibly important law to move the state‚Äôs electric grid to 100% clean energy by no later than 2045. This bill is a step in the right direction.
"The great economic crisis of our time is that millions of American workers earn starvation wages. Large, profitable corporations owned by multi-billionaires should provide their employees with a living wage and decent working conditions."
Child care should not cost parents more than sending their kids to college. We need a revolution in child care in this country.

Really? That's funny..."
"The issue about Amazon is not just that the wealthiest person on earth, Jeff Bezos, is paying workers unlivable wages. It's about the ""new economy"" and the degradation of the human spirit‚Äîbreaking down people, spitting them out and simply replacing them with new bodies."
"Thank you President Obama for supporting Medicare for All. 

His support takes us another step toward ensuring that no one in the richest country in the history of the world has to forego health care because they cannot afford it."
"This week we have seen more and more evidence of President Trump‚Äôs dangerous disregard for the democratic norms of our country, and stunning revelations about his erratic and misguided policy decisions and his pathological lying. We live in dangerous and unprecedented times."
"Although Trump thinks his administration did a ""fantastic job"" handling the destruction in Puerto Rico, the crisis is far from over."
Did you know that your tax dollars are subsidizing CEOs' outrageous compensation?
"While we have more people in jail than any country, we are beginning to make progress on criminal justice reform. There is still a long way to go in creating a justice system that works for all, but we should celebrate the steps we are taking."
"Eight months later, it's clear that Trump's tax cuts are only working for the billionaire class and wealthy CEOs."
We cannot go back to the days when people could be denied insurance due to a pre-existing condition. We will fight any Republican efforts to end these protections.

Brett Kavanaugh was asked if the president has the power to pardon himself. He refused to answer.
"Amazon workers are urinating in bottles because they're afraid of failing to meet productivity targets, according to @J_Bloodworth who went undercover at an Amazon warehouse in the UK."
"If McDonald's can find the money to spend over $20 billion on stock buybacks, they can find the money to pay their workers a living wage. It is time we stop subsidizing McDonald‚Äôs starvation wages."

WATCH LIVE: Introducing the Stop Bad Employers by Zeroing Out Subsidies (BEZOS) Act
"It's time to get Jeff Bezos, the Waltons and other billionaires who won't pay a living wage off of welfare. Today I'm introducing legislation to give them a choice: pay workers a living wage, or pay for the public assistance your low-wage workers rely on."
The public still doesn‚Äôt have 96% of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh‚Äôs documents. What are Republicans hiding?
"Amazon is worth $1 TRILLION.

Jeff Bezos is worth $155 BILLION.

Thousands of Amazon workers have to rely on food stamps, Medicaid and public housing to survive. 

That is what a rigged economy looks like. Tomorrow we will introduce a bill to end subsidies for low-wage employers."
"President Trump is an unindicted co-conspirator in a crime. We should not confirm his Supreme Court justice nominee Brett Kavanaugh, a man who believes the president cannot be indicted or deposed."

"The median Amazon employee makes $13.67 an hour.

Many of those employees rely on food stamps, Medicaid and public housing to survive.

You know who pays for that? You do.

You know what Jeff Bezos makes every hour? $10,833,33

It's time for Amazon to get off corporate welfare."

"President Trump said yesterday he did a ""fantastic job"" in Puerto Rico. Meanwhile, new estimates put the death toll from Hurricane Maria at nearly 3,000. This is a disgrace."
".@amazon, if our claims about wages and working conditions at Amazon are inaccurate then prove it. 

Make public the number of people you hire through temporary staffing agencies like Integrity Staffing Solutions and make public the hourly rate and benefits those workers earn."
"A question for Amazon: If you‚Äôre so proud of the way you treat your workers, why are you relying on so many temporary workers who receive low wages, unreliable schedules and no benefits?"
"Amazon‚Äôs warehouses are one of the most dangerous places to work in the U.S. According to the NCOSH, seven Amazon workers have died on or near the job since 2013. I will be asking OSHA to investigate unsafe working conditions at Amazon fulfillment centers."
"Amazon is paying some of its employees to tweet positive stories about the company. Hmm, why is that?"
"Bottom line: No one working for the wealthiest person on Earth should have to rely on food stamps. No one working for a man who earns $260 million a day should be forced to sleep in their car. Yet that is what's happening at Amazon. 

My full response:"
"The American people are subsidizing Amazon workers‚Äô food stamps while their boss, Jeff Bezos, is the richest man in the world. It‚Äôs time to get Mr. Bezos off of welfare."
This is a catastrophic loss of American lives. The Trump administration's response to the crisis in Puerto Rico has been disturbingly inadequate. We must use the full resources of the United States government to help the island recover.
"Just 3% of Brett Kavanaugh's records have been released. If Republicans believe Kavanaugh deserves a lifetime seat on the Supreme Court, why are they afraid to show the American people what Kavanaugh has written?"
The Founding Fathers were fundamentally opposed to the kind of predatory lenders leeching off student borrowers today.
We know our health care system is profoundly broken when a family has to file for bankrupcy for saving their newborn's life.
Are you a current or former Amazon employee? Please share your experiences with Sen. Bernie Sanders.
Those of us who believe in democracy must understand the scope of the challenge of authoritarianism if we are to effectively confront it.
"Billionaires shouldn't be on welfare. If the owners of large, profitable corporations won't pay workers a living wage, then we are going to tax them for 100% of the public assistance benefits their workers are forced to rely on."
Congratulations to the courageous workers and their unions at Disney World for their historic victory. I applaud everyone who stood up to demand that workers at one of the wealthiest corporations in the world should have a decent standard of living.
"John McCain was an American hero, a man of decency and honor and a friend of mine. He will be missed not just in the U.S. Senate but by all Americans who respect integrity and independence. Jane and I send our deepest condolences to his family."
"Instead of paying people to tweet positive things about his corporation, Jeff Bezos needs to get off welfare, improve working conditions at Amazon's warehouses and pay his workers a living wage."
"There is something fundamentally wrong when thousands of Amazon workers are on food stamps while their boss, Jeff Bezos, is the richest man in the world."
"While Jeff Bezos' wealth has increased $260 million every single day this year, he continues to pay many Amazon employees wages so low that they're forced to depend on taxpayer-funded programs such as food stamps, Medicaid and public housing to survive."
Incredible. According to a new poll 70 percent of Americans now support Medicare for all‚Äîincluding 52 percent of Republicans! The momentum is with us.
"Betsy DeVos has a brilliant idea. While paltry school budgets deny kids a decent education, she may let states use federal funds to buy guns for educators‚Äînot books, computers or pay raises. Guns. Meanwhile the Trump administration opposes all commonsense gun safety legislation."
The Koch brothers-funded Mercatus Center might not like that their report revealed Medicare for all will save Americans $2 trillion. But numbers don't lie.
"At a time when Trump is an unindicted co-conspirator in a crime, we shouldn‚Äôt confirm a Supreme Court justice picked by Trump, who believes the president cannot be indicted or deposed. The Senate must postpone Kavanaugh‚Äôs hearings until the ongoing investigations are complete."
"President Trump's associates who have pleaded guilty to or been convicted of serious crimes ‚Äì so far:

- His campaign chairman

- His lawyer

- His foreign policy advisors"
"Imagine proposing a plan that you know will kill thousands of Americans every year.

That's exactly what Donald Trump's EPA just did."
Here it is! A leading Republican just admitted that they plan to cut Medicare and Social Security to pay for the massive tax cuts they gave billionaires and large corporations.
"Our health care system isn't designed to provide quality, cost-effective care for all. It exists to make profits for insurance companies, drug companies and medical equipment suppliers. That must change. #MedicareForAll"
This teacher is one of many millions of Americans saddled with insurmountable student debt. It‚Äôs time to make college tuition free in America.
"I thank @jaketapper for admitting his ‚Äúfact check‚Äù on Medicare for All was not factual and editing his video.
 
Sadly, Tapper's video on Medicare for All along with other ‚Äúfact checks‚Äù is riddled with errors peddled by the Koch-funded Mercatus Center. Let's go through them:"
McDonald's just announced it is spending $6 billion on makeovers of its restaurants while still refusing to pay its workers a living wage.
"The good news is, the ideas that we have been talking about‚ÄîMedicare for all, making public colleges and universities tuition-free, leaving a healthy planet for our kids and grandkids‚Äîare now mainstream ideas supported by the vast majority of the American people."
"This must not go unnoticed. The Trump administration just announced their extremely dangerous plan to repeal the Clean Power Plan. Mr. Trump: You are threatening not only this generation, but you're threatening the lives of our children and grandchildren."
"This is how our rigged system works:

1) Republicans give huge tax breaks to their wealthy campaign contributors

2) Billionaires spend millions to elect Republicans

3) Republicans push cuts to Social Security, Medicare &amp; Medicaid to make the rich richer and everyone else poorer"
The cost of college has increased astronomically in just one generation. This isn't sustainable. We need to make public colleges and universities tuition-free.
What Trump and his friends in the fossil fuel industry are doing is criminal.

"Today, we remember and celebrate the life of one of the great entertainers in modern American history. Aretha, thank you for all that you have given us. You will not be forgotten."
"While thousands of Americans die each year because they lack access to health care they need, the top five health insurance companies last year made $21 billion in profits. 

We need a health care system that works for all, not just the wealthy."
I think there is a growing understanding that there is something fundamentally wrong when three people in America own more wealth than the bottom half of the country.
"I said it in 1993 and I will say it again now: If you want a simpler, more cost-effective health care system, the way forward is a Medicare for all, single-payer program."
Enough is enough! No one in America should go deeply in debt or bankrupt for the crime of getting an education. It is time to reduce the burden of student debt and make public colleges and universities tuition free.
"No, Secretary Zinke. The record-breaking wildfires in California have everything to do with climate change. We must confront the reality that climate change is already destroying tens of thousands of lives, and take concrete steps to avoid its worst consequences."

Here's how Trump's world of fiction is undermining our democracy and how we can fight back:
"By backing the Saudi coalition‚Äôs war in Yemen with weapons, aerial refueling, and targeting assistance, the United States is complicit in this atrocity. No one can seriously claim that our support for this war is actually making us safer."
"The U.S. has a president who is so ""tough"" that he can order tiny kids to be torn from their parents' arms. Unfortunately, he's not so tough that he can speak out on human rights abuses in Saudi Arabia. Wouldn't it be nice if we had a leader who sounded more like @JustinTrudeau."
It's never been more clear who the Trump Administration is really working for.
"""There are so many medical GoFundMe pages at this point that I can't imagine if pre-existing condition protections got repealed. We'd all be asking our family and friends for money."" ‚ÄîSarah Rentz, 32 year old breast cancer survivor."
"This is an outrageous move. It's entirely legitimate for democratic governments to highlight human rights issues with undemocratic governments. We must continue to do so. The US must be clear in condemning repression, especially when done by governments that receive our support."
"Despite Trump‚Äôs tax giveaway to the wealthy and large corporations, real wages have actually gone down, not up, since June 2017. The economy may be the best in history for billionaires like Jeff Bezos, but it is not ""booming"" for the average worker."
"We cannot continue to have a ""debtor prison"" system in the United States. Our destructive and unjust cash bail process is part of our broken criminal justice system and it must be ended."
Trump claimed that you need a photo ID to buy groceries. What he's actually doing is making the case for voter suppression.
"While Jeff Bezos spends $12 million renovating his 5th mansion, this Amazon employee is forced to live out of her car."
"Trump promised a nation of ""law and order"" and to be ""tough on crime."" So why is he letting corporate criminals off the hook?"
"A cancer patient should be able to focus all their time and energy on their road to recovery. Instead, this single mom had to worry about $160,000 in medical bills. We need #MedicareForAll."
"No matter what Fox News comes up with to try to discredit Medicare for all, a majority of the American people have made it clear time and time again that we should join every other major country and make health care a right."
Fox News wants you to believe that Medicare for All will limit your intake of donuts. Here's why they're wrong:
"Even with private health insurance, Kim Leighton is still paying thousands of dollars for life-saving health care. Our system is broken. We need Medicare for all."
"What insurance company CEOs made in 2017:
-Leonard Schleifer (Regeneron): $95.3 million
-Dave Wichmann (UnitedHealth): $83.2 million
-Mark Bertolini (Aetna): $58.7 million

We need a system that provides health care for all, not massive compensation for a few CEOs.#MedicareForAll"
"Americans are sick and tired of our wasteful, inefficient, dysfunctional health care system. They want Medicare for all."
How does a universal health care system actually work? Hear it from Canadian doctors who have seen it firsthand.
"If Norway, along with every other major country on Earth, can make health care a right, why can't the United States do the same?"
Fox News is at it again. They can't accept what a right-wing think tank found: that Medicare for All will actually save our country trillions of dollars.
"At a time when gun violence and school shootings are becoming more and more routine, the last thing we need is to enable anyone ‚Äì including people who otherwise couldn‚Äôt legally purchase a gun ‚Äì to ‚Äòprint‚Äô a gun on a 3-D printer."
"""To anybody who thinks it‚Äôs fine to take away coverage for pre-existing conditions, you need to know that without insurance, I would probably die."" Liz Leavens is one of many people afraid of what might happen if Republicans get rid of protections for pre-existing conditions."
Here's what happened when a Republican senator challenged a Canadian doctor on their single-payer health care system.
We took some American doctors to Canada to see a universal health care system up close. Here's what they learned:
"If every major country on Earth can guarantee health care to all and achieve better health outcomes, while spending substantially less per capita, please don't tell me that the United States cannot do the same."
"Thank you, Koch brothers, for accidentally making the case for Medicare for All!"
This is the reality of what it's like to work for Amazon.
Cynthia Murray has worked at Walmart for 18 years and still doesn‚Äôt make $15 an hour. That is a disgrace.
For a company like Amazon which holds an unbelievable amount of wealth and power to treat its workers this way is simply unconscionable. This is the kind of corporate greed that is destroying the social fabric of our country.
Here are all the ways Trump has failed working families:
"Even a Koch brothers-funded attempt to trash Medicare for All can't hide the truth: Medicare for All will lead to a $2 TRILLION REDUCTION in national health expenditures over 10 years. 

That‚Äôs trillion with a ‚ÄúT.‚Äù"
If Roe v. Wade is overturned it will have an immediate impact on millions of women‚Äôs lives around the country. States are already trying to come as close to banning abortion as they possibly can.
"-40 million Americans still live in poverty
-30 million have no health insurance
-Half of older workers have no retirement savings

And what does Trump's tax plan accomplish? Make the very, very rich much richer. What a disgrace."
"""Do you know what it's like to not have food for your children?"" Listen to these two single mothers tell their stories about struggling every day just to survive in this economy."
"What a hypocrite! Given the choice between hiring American workers at a living wage or hiring much less expensive workers from China that he can exploit, Donald Trump opts for the low-wage overseas labor day in and day out."
Congratulations to the courageous workers and their unions at Disneyland for their wonderful victory. They are an inspiration to low-wage workers all over this country who are struggling for justice and dignity.
"More than 65% of the people in county or city jails on any given day in 2016 had not been convicted of a crime, often because they lack the money to pay bail. 

In other words, we have criminalized poverty."
Amazon just announced that they made $2.5 billion in profits last quarter. Why does Jeff Bezos still refuse to treat his workers with respect and dignity?
"I can't believe we have to say this in the year 2018: Poverty is not a crime.

Hundreds of thousands of Americans, convicted of nothing, should not be in jail because they can't afford their bail."
I met with some of Vermont's smart and talented young people - students participating in the @ALBoysNation and @ALAforVeterans Girls Nation. Looking forward to great things from these student leaders.
It's extremely concerning that the person charged with administering Medicare would rather throw 32 million Americans off of health insurance than join every major nation and guarantee health care as a fundamental right.
"It is, quite simply, a travesty that in the year 2018 we continue to have debtors‚Äô prisons in the United States."
Greedy Wall Street vulture funds must not be allowed to reap huge profits off the suffering and misery of the Puerto Rican people for a second longer.
"Hundreds of thousands of people in the U.S. have not been convicted of a crime but are incarcerated because they cannot afford bail. Today, we are introducing legislation to end that disgrace."
"Poverty is not a crime and hundreds of thousands of Americans, convicted of nothing, shouldn't be in jail because they can't afford cash bail. Our destructive and unjust cash bail process is part of our broken criminal justice system and must be ended."
It is incomprehensible to me that we have a president who gave massive tax breaks to billionaires but wants to cut the WIC nutrition program for low-income pregnant women and their babies.
"If he is confirmed, Brett Kavanaugh will be a rubber stamp on the Supreme Court for an extreme, right-wing agenda pushed by corporations and billionaires. We must do everything we can to see that he is defeated."
"Please remember that our ideas, including Medicare for all, are not radical. They are what the vast majority of the American people want."
"Before Roe v. Wade an estimated 200,000 - 1.2 million illegal abortions took place in the US every year. We cannot return to the days of back-room abortions, when countless women died or were maimed."
Thank you to the young people standing up to fossil fuel corporations and leading the movement to combat climate change. #ThisIsZeroHour
"Looks like that $4,000 pay raise Trump promised working people from his tax cuts was just another lie he told to help enrich profitable corporations and billionaires."
"I hope my Republican colleagues who believe that women, not the government, have the right to control their own bodies will stand with the overwhelming majority of Americans, including a majority of Republicans, who don't want Roe v. Wade overturned."
"Does anyone really believe Trump is concerned with human rights in Iran, when he‚Äôs had only kind things to say about authoritarians around the world, including Putin in Russia, Kim Jong Un in North Korea, Duterte in the Philippines and Mohammad Bin Salman in Saudi Arabia?"
"No, Obama improved relations with Iran. Are YOU, President Trump, planning to start a war to get re-elected?"

Private prison companies invested hundreds of thousands of dollars in Donald Trump‚Äôs presidential campaign. Now they are getting their reward with Trump's inhumane immigration policies and corporate tax cuts.
How does it happen that companies which are owned by some of the wealthiest people in this country have workers not making enough money to feed their families and live in dignity? That is an issue the mainstream media has got to address.
American Airlines made $1.9 billion in profits last year. Their workers should not have to rely on public assistance programs like food stamps and Medicaid to try to get by.
The average cashier at McDonald's would have to work for 895 years to make what the company's CEO makes in one year. That is simply immoral.
"Republicans have been trying to overturn Roe v Wade for more than 40 years. Now that they are on the verge of achieving their dream, they are downplaying the consequences. We‚Äôre not fooled."
"We face an unprecedented situation of a president who, for whatever reason, refuses to acknowledge the full scope of the threat to American democracy."
"The United States is the only major country not to guarantee ANY paid maternity or paternity leave. That is a disgrace that has got to change. 

It should not depend upon the generosity of one's coworkers whether a parent is able to be with their newborn baby."
"If President Trump won't confront Putin about interference in our elections and his destabilizing policies, Congress must act. Tweets and speeches are fine, but we need more from Republican senators now."
"If Trump won't protect the U.S. from Russian interference in our elections, then my Republican colleagues must join with Democrats to make it happen or all of their tweets and speeches are worthless. I call on them to support my resolution."
I am introducing a resolution at 11:20 AM on the Senate floor to demand that the President of the United States represent the interests of the American people and not Russia. Watch here:
"When millions of Americans are struggling economically, when veterans are homeless and when 1 in 5 patients can't afford the medications they need, the U.S. shouldn't have this grotesque level of inequality. This is why we need a political revolution."
"""Towards the end of the time I was [at Amazon], I was so depressed and I kept telling myself if this is the best my life is going to get, why am I even still here?"" - Seth King, former Amazon employee."
"Today we mark the 100th birthday of Nelson Mandela, who led the struggle to end the horrible apartheid system in South Africa. Let his courage and commitment to equality and justice serve as an example to all of us as we work to create a better world."
"If President Trump won't confront Putin about interference in our elections and his destabilizing policies, Congress must act. Tweets and speeches are fine, but we need more from Republican senators now.

Congress must take these 5 actions to rein in Trump's dangerous behavior:"
"What world is Trump living in? Does he not understand what's going on? Is he being blackmailed because the Russians have compromising information on him? Or is he sympathetic to Putin's style of authoritarianism? 

Congress must step in and stop Russian meddling in our elections."
Yesterday was a good day for Putin and the oligarchs in Russia. But it was a bad day for people in the United States and all over the world who believe in democracy and who are trying to understand what world our idiot president lives in.
"ICYMI: Watch the CEOs vs. Workers town hall, aired last night, on the enormous disparity between the wealth of corporate executives and the wages and treatment of workers at companies like Amazon, McDonald's, Disney, Walmart and American Airlines."
"The GOP leadership must decide whether Congress will continue being cowardly, obedient followers of the president's absurd policies. Despite battling brain cancer, Sen. John McCain has shown more courage in standing up to Trump than virtually the entire Republican Party combined."

"We saved a seat for the CEOs of American Airlines, Disney, Amazon, Walmart and McDonald‚Äôs in case they have the courage to face their workers. Tune in at 7 pm ET on Facebook to see if they‚Äôll show up."
Today is a good day for Putin and the oligarchs in Russia. It is a bad day for people in the United States and all over the world who believe in democracy and who are trying to understand what world our idiot president lives in.
"Today Jeff Bezos, the CEO of Amazon, became the richest man in modern history with a net worth over $150 billion. But will he face his own workers at our town hall tonight? Probably not."
"I stand with the Amazon workers fighting for decent working conditions and a living wage on #PrimeDay.

While Jeff Bezos' wealth increases by $275 million a day, Amazon workers are afraid to take bathroom breaks at work and are grossly underpaid."
Millions of Americans have risked their lives to defend our democracy. What would those brave men and women think if they saw President Trump's pathetic performance today?
Will Jeff Bezos have the guts to face Amazon workers at our town hall tonight at 7 pm ET and explain why he's worth $151 billion but won't pay them a living wage?
"How pathetic! Republicans who tell us how much they believe in ""freedom"" and ""national security"" are now caving in to a president who sides with former KGB leader Putin, rather than our own intelligence community."
"President Trump‚Äôs press conference with Putin was an embarrassing spectacle. Rather than make clear that interference in our elections is unacceptable, Trump instead accepted Putin‚Äôs denials and cast doubt on the conclusions of our intelligence community. This is not normal."
"Please join me, along with workers from Amazon, Disney, McDonald‚Äôs, American Airlines and Walmart, for a town hall TONIGHT at 7 p.m. where we will discuss an issue you don't hear much about in the mainstream media. Watch at"
"I stand with the @AFTunion in demanding fundamental changes to our national priorities. We don't need tax breaks for billionaires. We need to invest in high-quality public education, universal child care and making public colleges and universities tuition-free."
"How does it happen that there are major corporations in America where CEOs receive extravagant compensation packages, who pay their workers wages so low that many of them are forced to rely on food stamps to survive? 

That is what we will discuss tonight."
"Last year American Airlines made $1.9 billion in profits. Its CEO Doug Parker is on track to make $31 million this year.

They need to explain why 27% of workers at their subsidiary Envoy Air said they must accept food stamps and other public assistance to make ends meet."
"Universal health care in America is not a radical idea anymore, thanks to the millions who have spoken out to demand a just health care system. 63% of American voters now support a Medicare-for-all health care system."
"Walmart‚Äôs CEO Doug McMillon made about $11,000/hour in compensation last year. I'd like to hear from him why he thinks his workers don't deserve to be paid a living wage of $15/hour."
The average cashier at McDonald's would have to work for 895 years to make what the company's CEO makes in one year. That is insane.
More than 2 out of 3 Disneyland workers say they go hungry. That does not sound like the ‚Äúhappiest place on Earth‚Äù to me.
"The Walton family, the owners of Wal-Mart, is the wealthiest family in America. Middle class taxpayers should not have to subsidize Walmart‚Äôs low wages to the tune of at least $6.2 billion each and every year. That's absurd."
"The billionaires in the Trump administration should tell that to the:
- 140 million Americans struggling to pay for basic living expenses
- The more than 30 million people who have no health insurance 
- The seniors trying to live on Social Security benefits of $12,000 a year."
"This former Amazon manager suffered a mini-stroke after working continuous 16-hour days, sometimes without days off for two weeks at a time. This should not be happening in the richest country in the history of the world."
"We must speak with one voice in making clear to Vladimir Putin: ""We will not allow you to interfere in our democratic processes or those of our allies."" President Trump himself should be the one to bring this message to Putin."
Does Disney CEO Bob Iger have a good explanation for why he is being compensated more than $400 million while workers at Disneyland are homeless and relying on food stamps to feed their families?
"I'm proud to stand with Vermont nurses in their fight for a fair contract that treats them with respect and dignity. At the end of the day, this struggle is about priorities. It‚Äôs about prioritizing patient care over profits."
"""The only way that I can see to deploy this much financial resource is by converting my Amazon winnings into space travel."" ‚ÄìJeff Bezos, worth $147 billion

Mr. Bezos, here's another idea. Pay your workers enough so that thousands of them no longer have to rely on food stamps."
"Please join me, along with workers from Amazon, Disney, McDonald‚Äôs, American Airlines and Walmart, for a town hall this Monday night at 7pm where we will discuss something that is never discussed. It will be livestreamed at  You don't want to miss it."
"Extraordinary reporting by @JaneFerguson5, showing us pictures of the Yemen devastation that the Saudi coalition would rather we didn‚Äôt see. The US must stop supporting this catastrophic war. We cannot say we did not know."
"Over and over again, Donald Trump tells us the U.S. economy is ‚Äúabsolutely booming.‚Äù Then why have wages gone down, not up, by 5 cents an hour since June of last year after adjusting for inflation?"
If Jeff Bezos is so proud of the working conditions at Amazon he should face his own employees at our town hall on Monday.
"We spend $700 billion on defense, more than the next 10 nations combined, and end up with 30 million uninsured and crumbling infrastructure. 

Mr. President, instead of demanding that Europe spend more on planes and guns, why don‚Äôt we join them in guaranteeing health care to all."
How would Trump's latest Supreme Court nominee rule on Roe v. Wade? Let candidate Donald Trump give you a hint.
I rise to oppose the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court:
"Jeff Bezos, the CEO of Amazon, says he is ""very proud"" of the working conditions at Amazon. Maybe he should listen to the story of this former Amazon worker who, after breaking her foot on the job, was told to take ibuprofen and finish her shift or go home with unpaid time."
"I hope the CEOs of Amazon, Disney, McDonald's, Walmart and American Airlines have the guts to sit on a panel with their own employees at our town hall Monday night. Watch live on July 16 at 7 pm EST on my Facebook page."
Happy #CowAppreciationDay
Nothing is more important now than doing everything in our power to stop the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.
"President Trump‚Äôs Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh will be a rubber-stamp for an extreme, right-wing agenda pushed by corporations and billionaires. We must mobilize the American people to defeat Trump‚Äôs right-wing, reactionary nominee."
Bernie responds to Trump‚Äôs Supreme Court pick. Leave your questions for him in the comments:
"If Trump appoints another right-wing extremist to the Supreme Court, I have very serious concerns about justice in this country, and what will happen to the people and future of our nation."
"Stop just talking about high drug prices @realDonaldTrump. Do something. It's not just Pfizer that can raise drug prices ""for no reason."" It's every drug company. In case you didn't know, that's why we have the highest prescription drug prices in the world. (1/2)"
Listen to these Patriotic Millionaires: it's patriotic for the very wealthy and corporations to want to pay their fair share in taxes. with @PatrioticMills
The Trump administration's slavish devotion to corporate profits and their contempt for the health and well-being of Americans and people throughout the world is beyond appalling.
"Let your friends, family and co-workers know. If Trump nominates a right-wing reactionary to the Supreme Court, as is widely expected, we must mobilize the American people to defeat that nomination."
"The bottom line is: health care is a right, not a privilege. People should not be forced to live in pain or avoid medical treatment because they lack the funds. We need Medicare for all, and we need it now."
"Ed Schultz was a passionate defender of American workers and strongly supported trade policies that work for all, not just large corporations. For many years his voice has been strong, steady &amp; against forces of corporate greed. Ed was a friend of mine and will be sorely missed."
"Scott Pruitt was the worst EPA administrator in the history of the agency. Not only has he acted, time and time again, in an unethical manner, but he has led the agency in exactly the wrong direction."
"The United States must lead the world in transforming our energy system by moving aggressively to energy efficiency and sustainable energy. When we do that, we protect the planet, create jobs and save consumers money."
".@realDonaldTrump, climate change is real, very real‚Äîand it is devastating our planet. Stop protecting the interests and short-term profits of the fossil fuel industry, and start worrying about the world future generations will inherit."
"In 2002 I voted against the creation of DHS and the establishment of ICE. That was the right vote. Now, it is time to do what Americans overwhelmingly want: abolish the cruel, dysfunctional immigration system we have today and pass comprehensive immigration reform."
"We cannot risk a Supreme Court that would put in jeopardy a woman's right to control her own body.

Our job: mobilize Americans to demand the Senate must not vote on any potential Supreme Court justice until people have had a chance to make their voices heard in November."
Have you worked a minimum wage fast food job? What is it like to try to support yourself or your family? Do you have access to benefits or career opportunities?
It's time to reduce the heavy burden of student debt that is weighing down the lives of millions of former college students and make public colleges and universities tuition-free.
"No parent should have to worry about outrageous medical bills while their child is sick. We must pass Medicare for all so that health care is a right for all people in America, not a privilege for a few who can afford it."
Thank you to the thousands of people turning out today to protest Trump's cruel policy of separating families. The United States of America must never be about tearing apart families or locking up children in cages. #FamiliesBelongTogether

"Our thoughts today are with the victims of the horrific shooting at the Capital Gazette yesterday, their families and their colleagues."
"I am excited to announce that on July 16 we will hold a live streamed town hall with workers from Amazon, Disney, McDonald‚Äôs and Walmart. I hope their CEOs will have the guts to sit on a panel with their own employees."
"When it comes time to decide on a replacement for Justice Kennedy, I hope that my Republican colleagues who believe that women, not the government, have the right to control their bodies will stand with those of us who oppose any nominee who would deny women the right to choose."
"We should listen to what Sen. McConnell said in 2016. President Trump should not nominate, and the Senate should not confirm, a Supreme Court justice until the American people have had the opportunity to make their voices heard in November."
"The reality is that for many large corporations, wage theft has been an essential part of their business model. That has to change."
"To nobody‚Äôs surprise the U.S. Supreme Court, in a 5-4 decision, sided with big money interests and against the needs of working people. Make no mistake about it: this decision is a direct assault on working families all over America."
The Trump administration‚Äôs travel ban was never about keeping America safe. We need only look at Trump‚Äôs own words to understand that this has always been a racist and anti-Islamic attempt to ban Muslims from entering this country.
Rep. @PeterWelch visited a border patrol ‚Äúprocessing facility‚Äù in Texas holding hundreds of children. Here is what he saw.
Right-wing extremists in every state and every branch of government have worked for decades to make it more and more difficult for women to access abortion. We cannot let them win. Abortion is a constitutional right that must be protected.
"The Supreme Court sided with fear, racism and xenophobia and against the American ideals of religious freedom and tolerance. Trump's travel ban isn't about keeping America safe. Just look at Trump‚Äôs own words. It's always been a racist attempt to ban Muslims from entering the US."
Fox News' coverage of last week's horrific situation of children being separated from their parents at the border was a disgrace.
"Never forget that corporations and their executives profit off of the Trump administration's inhumane immigration policies, along with our system of mass incarceration which locks up 2.2 million people in this country."
.@RepJayapal visited a federal prison and met with asylum seekers who had been transferred from the border. What they told her is horrifying. We need to fight back against Trump's cruel immigration policy.
"Trump's pathological dishonesty is undermining our democracy, setting a terrible example for our children and isolating us from our democratic allies around the world.  Now is the time for the American people to fight back on every front."
How has failed U.S. economic policy contributed to families seeking asylum at the border?  With @ManuelPerezIPS
This child psychiatrist explains the unbelievable trauma inflicted on kids separated from their parents at the border:
"Trump tells us every day how much he hates immigrants and how much he loves American workers. But last year, Trump chose to hire only one American worker even though thousands of Americans wanted to work at his Mar-a-Lago resort. The rest were low-wage temporary guest workers."
"What a hypocrite! @realDonaldTrump makes hateful and racist rants every day about how immigrants are ‚Äúbad‚Äù for the country, but he had no problem hiring undocumented immigrants to help him build the Trump Hotel in DC or Trump Tower in New York City."
"Right now we must strengthen the global coalition of progressive democrats. While authoritarians promote division and hatred, we will promote unity, inclusion, and an agenda based on economic, social, racial and environmental justice."
Crystal Mason is facing five years in jail‚Äîfor the crime of voting. (with @ShaunKing)
"Trump's strategy of hateful rhetoric and trying to divide the American people up is nothing new. It has been used by authoritarian leaders all over the world. Our job is stand together, fight back, and create the kind of country that we all know we can become."
The United States government should use every tool available to lower outrageously high prescription drug prices. It's time to put the pharmaceutical industry on notice that the era of charging unconscionable prices must end.
"Six months after Trump and Republicans in Congress passed their tax plan, they are still lying about who it really helps. Here is what's really going on as a result of their scam:"
"As it happens, I personally believe that it is totally appropriate for the UN to focus on poverty in the United States ‚Äì the richest county in the history of the world."
"Trump's executive order does nothing to ensure the 2,400 kids who have been torn from their parents will be reunited with their families."
"Trump's political strategy: 
1) Give tax breaks to billionaires, throw millions off health insurance, cut Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid
2) Blame immigrants (or blacks, Muslims, gays, Jews) as the cause of all problems

This is the kind of hate politics demagogues always use"
"Trump thinks he can win votes by showing how tough he is on these little children being separated at the border. Well, that's pretty pathetic and his policies must be defeated."
"Because the American people spoke up, Trump has changed his policy of tearing children away from their parents and locking them up in detention cages. But the executive order that he issued today goes nowhere near as far as it should go."
"Trump‚Äôs executive order merely replaces one inhumane act with another. In response to the overwhelming public outrage at his policy of tearing children away from their parents at the border, this administration thinks the appropriate response is to indefinitely detain families."
Fact check: The Trump administration cannot keep their own story straight about the abhorrent practice of separating families at the border. Here is the truth about what's happening.
"When you have the most powerful nation on earth saying that it is acceptable to tear children from the arms of their parents, you are sending a signal to countries around the world that this is how they can treat immigrants and minorities. That is a very dangerous signal."
"To be politically successful, Trump needs to create enemies and divide us up. He needs to turn men against women, white against black, straight against the LGBT community, Christian against Muslim, native born against immigrant. We will not let him win."
"The Acting Director of ICE can't bring himself to say that separating families is humane, yet he insists on continuing this horrifying policy."
"Since 1990, 4 defense contractors (including Lockheed &amp; Boeing) spent over $714 million on lobbying and campaign contributions. Yesterday, their wish for endless war was granted while children in America go hungry and veterans sleep on the street."
"""We should be able to agree that we will not keep kids in child internment camps indefinitely and hidden away from public view."" ‚Äì @RepCummings"
"What is happening at the border right now constitutes torture, according to @amnesty. Separating parents from their children is inhumane and must be stopped."
We cannot spend more on our military than the next 10 nations combined while millions of Americans do not have food and housing and health care. It‚Äôs about time we got our national priorities right. That is why I voted against spending $716 billion on the military today.
The United States of America is not and must never be about locking up little children in cages on the southern border.
"BREAKING: The U.S. government released horrifying footage of a child detention center in Texas. Together, we must defeat this inhumane and un-American action."

This nun has a message for the members of the Trump administration who are using the Bible to justify ripping immigrant children away from their parents.
I say to Disney CEO Bob Iger: you can lead this country in ending the type of corporate greed which is causing so much pain. Start paying all of your workers a livable wage with decent benefits.
"Together, we will defeat the Trump administration's inhumane and un-American policy of ripping babies from the arms of their mothers and fathers."
"The Trump admin, in its unabashed cruelty, is carving out a unique place in American history. It's not just support for racism, sexism, homophobia, xenophobia and religious bigotry. They've hit a new low by separating kids from their parents and placing them in detention centers."
The U.S. must stop its unconstitutional and unauthorized participation in this war and support the UN‚Äôs effort to get a cease-fire. No child should have to live like this.
President Trump's effusive remarks about Kim Jong Un are just the latest example of his very troubling affinity for authoritarians.
"For whatever reason‚Äîyou got me, I don't know why‚ÄîTrump and his administration want to make a bad situation even worse when it comes to health care in this country."
Se estima que los transportistas portuarios son timados por un monto de $850 millones cada a√±o.
It's a simple question:  Should we listen to the majority of the American people who say they oppose spending more money on the military or should we listen to the lobbyists from the military industrial complex?
"This is what oligarchy looks like. This is what greed is doing to our country.

Amazon (whose CEO, Jeff Bezos, is the richest person in the world) used its enormous power to kill a modest tax designed to address the affordable housing crisis in Seattle."
"The Trump administration‚Äôs ‚Äúzero tolerance‚Äù policy of separating children, including infants as young as one year old, from their parents at the border is inhumane, cruel and an affront to our values as Americans."
"To afford a two-bedroom apartment, a worker making the federal minimum wage would need to work 122 hours a week. The current federal minimum wage of $7.25 is a starvation wage and that has got to change."
"This merger represents a gross concentration of power that runs counter to the public good. At a time when our telecommunications and media industries are already too concentrated, we should be focused on opening those markets to more competition, not less."
Why does Trump's health secretary care more about protecting the profits of the drug industry than the lives of Americans who can‚Äôt afford the highest prescription drug prices in the world?
"Two years after 49 people were killed at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, it is a national tragedy that we have not done a single thing to prevent another mass shooting. We must pass gun safety legislation now. My thoughts are with those who are remembering their loved ones today."
No married couple in America should have to choose between divorce or bankruptcy to afford health care. We must pass Medicare for All.
Port truck drivers are cheated out of an estimated $850 million a year. They're driving for 20 hours a day and taking home paychecks worth nothing. They are denied health care and overtime pay. This is modern-day slavery.
"While very light on substance, Trump and Kim Jong Un's meeting is a positive step in de-escalating tensions and addressing the threat of North Korea‚Äôs nuclear weapons. Congress has a key role to play in making sure this is a meaningful process, not just a series of photo ops."
"Apply for paid fall internships in Sen. Sanders' Washington D.C., Burlington and St. Johnsbury offices. The deadline to apply is June 22."
"Since 1995, Boeing, Lockheed Martin and United Technologies have paid nearly $3 billion in fines or related settlements for fraud or misconduct. Yet, those three companies alone received about $800 billion in defense contracts over the past 18 years."
"Over and over again, Republicans say we cannot possibly afford to make health care a right through a Medicare-for-all program.

But when it comes to spending $716 billion on the military, all of a sudden there's deafening silence from my Republican colleagues about the deficit."
"It‚Äôs about time we got our national priorities right. I believe in a strong national defense, but we cannot continue to give the Pentagon and defense contractors a blank check while we ignore the basic needs of working families."
"We have a racist criminal justice system that costs us billions of dollars, ruins lives and allows private prisons to profit off of human misery. It's time for real criminal justice reform."
"I find it very strange that President Trump has such a hard time getting along with the leaders of the world's major democracies, but feels very comfortable with despots and authoritarian leaders."
"It's a travesty that the Supreme Court upheld Ohio‚Äôs voter suppression efforts. Instead of making people jump through hoops to vote, states should pass automatic voter registration and same-day registration. Politicians afraid of large voter turnouts are political cowards."
"Pope Francis is right. We must reduce our dependence on fossil fuels and transform our energy system to renewable energy. If we do not, the consequences will be catastrophic."
"Obamacare made it illegal for insurance companies to refuse coverage to the more than 130 million Americans with pre-existing conditions. If Trump gets his way, that protection will be repealed."
"I find it very strange that President Trump has such a hard time getting along with the leaders of the world's major democracies but feels very comfortable with despots and authoritarian leaders like Putin, Xi Jinping, Duterte and Mohammad Bin Salman."

Privatizing the VA would be an insult to the more than 22 million veterans who risked their lives to defend our country.
More than 2 out of 3 Disneyland workers say they go hungry. That does not sound like the ‚Äúhappiest place on Earth‚Äù to me.
"In their never-ending quest to throw millions off health insurance and raise premiums, the Trump Administration is now arguing in court that it should be legal for insurance companies to discriminate against the 130 million people with pre-existing conditions. That is a disgrace."
"Instead of giving huge tax breaks to corporations who shut down in the United States and send jobs abroad to low-wage countries, we must invest in creating worker-owned companies."
A billionaire shouldn't have any more of a right to run for office than a working stiff who can't afford to raise the millions of dollars needed for a campaign.
"Fox News Senior Judicial Analyst @Judgenap agrees with me: It is Congress' responsibility to decide when to put our young men and women in harm's way, not the president."
"Disney's CEO said the company had a ""great quarter."" Disneyland employees who can't afford rent or food beg to differ."
"We all hope that the summit between Trump and Kim Jong Un is successful. Getting rid of North Korea's nuclear weapons through a credible process would be a major step forward for world peace. But when Trump praises Kim as ‚Äúvery honorable,‚Äù he makes a mockery of American values."
"Trump's war on the poor continues. First he wants to throw millions off nutrition assistance and Medicaid, and now he's going after affordable housing. Trump's agenda is simple: tax breaks for the rich, devastating cuts for the poor. We must fight back and create a moral economy."
"Rusty Williams says medical cannabis helped him get through chemotherapy and saved his life. We should be allowing states to move forward with legalization efforts, not interfering with the great progress that has been made."
I believe that we have become far too comfortable with the United States engaging in military interventions all over the world. We need to ask this very hard question: is a perpetual war necessary to keep us safe?
"Disney makes $9 billion in profits, gives its CEO over $400 million and yet Disneyland workers can't afford to put a roof over their heads."
"The reality is that Disney‚Äôs greed, and the greed of corporate America, is destroying the social fabric of our country. This type of ruthless capitalism is not an economic model that we should be embracing. We can and we must do better."
The voices of the Palestinians are rarely heard. This is what life is like for those who are living in Gaza under a 10 year blockade:

"If we were a poor country, it would be reasonable to question whether we can achieve universal health care.

But we are not. We're the richest country in the history of the world. We can and must make health care a right to all."
What is the moral defense of a company like Disney that makes $9 billion in profits and pays a 30-year employee so little that she goes hungry?
We have to decide as a nation whether information about what we do with our lives should be sold to companies that will exploit that information.
"It costs $30,000 to send a California student to UCLA for a year. To send someone to prison, it costs $75,000.

We need to be a nation that invests in jobs and education, not jails and incarceration."
This is not what Donald Duck and Mickey Mouse are supposed to be about. Disney must pay all of its workers a living wage.
"I want to hear the moral defense of a company like Disney that makes $9 billion in profits, $400 million for their CEO and has a 30-year worker going hungry."
Over the next decade we will spend nearly $1 trillion jailing our fellow citizens. Imagine what we could accomplish if we reduced that number by 10 or 20 percent?
"This is what a rigged economy looks like: Working 100 hours in a week, not getting paid and actually owing the company a check.

Port truck drivers in this country deserve justice!"
"Truck drivers deserve to be treated with respect and dignity, not like modern-day indentured servants. That is what we are here in California today to demand."
"We are joining Disneyland workers today to say: If Disney can afford to pay its CEO up to $423 million, it can afford to pay all of its workers a living wage."
"Trump‚Äôs haphazard and reckless plan to impose tariffs on Canada and the European Union is an absolute disaster that will cause unnecessary economic pain to farmers, manufacturers and consumers in Vermont and around the country."
I have a feeling ABC will not be asking on its nightly news program tonight how Disney can make $9 billion in profits while three-quarters of Disneyland employees can‚Äôt afford basic living expenses.
Even Fox News is fed up with Trump's pathetic and evidence-free conspiracy theories.
"We cannot forget that the people of Puerto Rico, who are American citizens, are still suffering from the devastation of Hurricane Maria and need our help."
You want to talk about what it means to be anti-wealth? Jeff Bezos capturing $133 billion in wealth while paying his workers starvation wages for backbreaking work is anti-wealth.
"Memorial Day is a time to pay special tribute to service members who paid the ultimate sacrifice and to honor and support their families. We should be united in commemorating the sacrifices of those who gave, as Lincoln said, ‚Äúthe last full measure of devotion‚Äù to our country."
"When Trump tells us the economy is ""booming,"" please remember:
- Over 40% of Americans don't have enough savings to cover a $400 emergency expense
- 43% can't afford the basics to live
- Over 25% of adults skipped necessary medical care last year because they couldn't afford it"
"Instead of spending $20 billion to raise the minimum wage at Walmart to $16.66 an hour, Walmart is putting more money in the pockets of their wealthy shareholders. 

This is what corporate greed looks like."
I have serious concerns when you have a president of the United States who is constantly trying to undermine democratic institutions. That is wrong and together we must fight back.
"If Finland and other Nordic countries can make child care affordable and accessible to all, the United States should be able to as well."
"From the beginning, when Trump impulsively decided that he would meet with Kim Jong Un, it has been clear that the summit involved very little preparation. The threat of North Korea‚Äôs nuclear program is a very serious issue that requires serious diplomacy."
President Trump: you are not improving health care when you deny funding to Planned Parenthood and deny millions of women their provider of health care. Stop the attack on women's health.
"At a time when banks have never been more profitable, Congress voted yesterday to give them another massive gift in the form of deregulation. Our job is to break up the largest financial institutions in the country, not reward their greed and recklessness."
"I am concerned that despite some very good provisions in the VA MISSION Act, it continues a trend toward the slow, steady privatization of the VA. I will vote against it."
"How sad is it that we now have students in this country who are expecting violence in their schools. As Congresswoman @RosaDelauro says, the Congress must stand up to the NRA and pass gun safety legislation. Enough is enough."
"Thank you @amazonnews for your response to our video. I remain deeply concerned about Amazon, an enormously profitable corporation, paying workers wages that are so low that they are forced to depend on federal programs like Medicaid, food stamps and public housing for survival."
"Amazon founder Jeff Bezos' wealth increases by $275 million every single day. Meanwhile, Amazon workers have to rely on food stamps and public assistance just to survive. This is what a rigged economy is all about."
There's a three-letter word stopping us from passing common sense gun safety legislation: NRA.
This is the latest disgraceful attack on women‚Äôs rights by the Trump administration. Title X funds provide much-needed family planning services for millions of people around this country.
"There's little left to be said about the horrific school shooting tragedies that we've seen over and over ‚Äì today in Texas. These are very sick acts. 

Congress and Trump must finally have the courage to stand up to the NRA and do what the American people want. Enough is enough!"
"The three wealthiest people in America own more wealth than the bottom 50 percent‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääover 160 million people. Meanwhile, almost half of families in America can't afford basic necessities. Is that really the kind of society we want to be living in?"
It is not a radical idea to say that every American citizen over the age of 18 should be automatically registered to vote.
"We are dealing with a crisis of inequality and that is why we must start making the wealthy pay their fair share in taxes, not give more breaks to those at the top."
The United States Senate just voted to repeal the disastrous FCC decision to end #NetNeutrality. We must demand that the House does the right thing and stands with the Senate to overturn this decision.
"Congratulations, President Trump, on being the first president in history whose speech on ""bringing down drug prices"" sent pharma stocks soaring."
The Senate just took an important step toward reversing the Trump administration‚Äôs disastrous decision to repeal #NetNeutrality. Now the House must side with the 86% of Americans who support net neutrality and pass this resolution to protect our free speech and democracy.
"Millions of people are given excessive parole, probation or sentences, whose lives are destroyed while taxpayers pay millions to lock people up. If we are going to address mass incarceration that has got to change."
"Up to 20% of incarcerated people in America are imprisoned because they lack the money to pay cash bail or fines for minor violations.
 
Let me say that again. Some 400,000 people are incarcerated today for crimes they haven't been convicted of. That is insane."

This is insane. In the United States of America as many as 20% of people incarcerated are behind bars for the crime of being poor.  (Featuring @ShaunKing)

I have strong concerns that the Trump administration is getting the U.S. more involved in a war in Yemen without congressional authorization. I'll be seeking further clarification on these activities. We must prevent the U.S. from getting dragged into another never-ending war.

Trump's tax bill was a scam from the very beginning. We have got to hold Republican leaders accountable for deceiving the American people and giving massive tax breaks to the wealthy and large corporations.
We are finally beginning to see some major victories in reforming our broken criminal justice system which has destroyed so many lives.
"Congratulations to teachers for leading this country forward. A nation which doesn‚Äôt educate its children properly will fail. Instead of spending billions on jails and incarceration, we must invest in our teachers and schools."

"Mick Mulvaney tells us everything we need to know about how Washington works, and why wealthy special interests make billions in campaign contributions. Government should be about representing ordinary Americans, not just the rich and the powerful."

"Trump is right that it would be useful to take a serious look at the Postal Service. He's dead wrong, however, if he believes the solution is to privatize the Postal Service. The reality is that since 2014 the Postal Service has made an operating profit of more than $2.7 billion."
Make no mistake about it: Trump is dead wrong. There is no way to resuscitate the job-killing Trans-Pacific Partnership without betraying the working families of our country.
"In a series of broken promises Trump made to the working people of this country, rejoining the job-killing Trans-Pacific Partnership would be the biggest yet. Rejoining the TPP would be a betrayal of American workers and a step in the wrong direction."

Billionaires get tax breaks. Teachers get broken chairs and flooded classrooms. As the wealthiest nation in history we've got to do better.
This takeaway from the Mark Zuckerberg hearing gets to the heart of the issue: how do we use Facebook and the internet without seeing an invasion of our personal privacy?
"President Trump has no legal authority for broadening the war in Syria. It is Congress, not the president, who determines whether our country goes to war, and Congress must not abdicate that responsibility."
Do we really want to live in a country where students have to go to the hospital because of stress over paying for college? Or should we make public colleges and universities tuition-free while also lowering the outrageous levels of student debt?
Mark Zuckerberg testified today about Facebook‚Äôs role in our democracy. Here are the most important questions we should ask concerning his testimony:
"Mark Zuckerberg testifying before the Senate is a good first step, but nowhere near enough. Today‚Äôs hearing must be the beginning, not the end, of the discussion about the dramatic impact Facebook, technology companies and the internet at large play in our society."
It's not a radical idea to say that women should get equal pay for equal work and the same economic opportunities as men. This is an issue of basic justice. #EqualPayDay
"Mike Pompeo is absolutely the wrong choice for secretary of state. He is a supporter of the Global Gag Rule. He opposes LGBTQ rights. And as the top recipient of money from the Koch brothers, he's stymied action on one of our most serious security threats: global climate change."

"Over and over, Trump falsely claimed that his $1.5 trillion tax cut bill would pay for itself. Today‚Äôs CBO report puts that myth to rest. Trump‚Äôs massive tax break for the wealthy and large corporations is the primary reason that the federal deficit will explode."

"Nearly 200 days after Hurricane Maria, in the richest country in the history of the world, some Puerto Ricans still don't have power ‚Äì but billionaires got tax cuts."
We are not living in a poor nation. We are living in the wealthiest nation in the history of the world. How do we have one of the highest rates of childhood poverty of any major country? How could it be that we don't guarantee health care to all people? We must demand change.
The legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. is not just remembering him. The legacy is for us to follow in his footsteps and transform our country.
Martin Luther King Jr. was a nonviolent revolutionary. It is up to us to follow in his footsteps and carry forth his mission to abolish racism and poverty. #MLK50 #IAM2018

"In the richest country in the history of the world, our teachers should be the best-paid in the developed world, not among the worst-paid. The teachers who are protesting now are an inspiration to all of us."
"50 years ago today Martin Luther King Jr. delivered a speech in Memphis, Tennessee as he stood in solidarity with sanitation workers who were on strike for better wages and working conditions. Listen to the speech here:"
I'll join civil rights and labor leaders tomorrow in Memphis to commemorate the 50th anniversary of Martin Luther King's assassination. Dr. King was not only one of the great civil rights leaders of the 20th century. He was also at the forefront of the fight for economic justice.
"Somebody told me that West Virginia, Oklahoma and Kentucky are ""red"" states. They got that wrong. These are the states where teachers are now leading the nation in the fight for workers' rights and adequate funding for education. Thank you teachers!"
The situation in Gaza is desperate. The unrest in Gaza will not end until the people there see hope for a decent future. The U.S. must work to bring Israel and the Palestinians together to end the blockade and develop policies that works for all.
The killing of Palestinian demonstrators by Israeli forces in Gaza is tragic. It is the right of all people to protest for a better future without a violent response.
"How absurd is it that we live in a country where Congress and many states give huge tax breaks to billionaires and large corporations, but fail to provide adequate funding for education?"
"For the future of our country, the credibility of our commitments, and the well-being of our armed forces, Congress cannot continue to abdicate the constitutionally mandated war-making responsibilities which the founding fathers gave to them."
"What are our priorities as a nation? Congress gives huge tax breaks to billionaires, while teachers in Oklahoma and other states are living on poverty-level salaries. Congratulations to the teachers in Oklahoma for standing up and fighting back."
Our veterans have put their lives on the line. We must do everything possible to ensure they receive the benefits they deserve ‚Äì not privatize the VA. Thank you to those who met in White River Junction today.
"Dr. David Shulkin, who has just been fired by Trump as Secretary of the VA, is right. We must not allow the VA to be privatized. Our job is to strengthen the VA, not dismember it."
"It's appalling that 10,000 people with disabilities died last year awaiting a decision from the Social Security Administration. This spending bill is a start to address the underfunded SSA, but we must keep working to expand and strengthen Social Security."
Every major veterans‚Äô organization in this country vigorously opposes the privatization of the VA. I stand with them. The Veterans Affairs Committee should not approve any nominee for secretary who supports the privatization of the VA.
"Linda Brown was an American heroine. Thanks to her struggle and sacrifice for equality, African American children today have greater access and better opportunities for quality education and higher-paying jobs. Linda Brown‚Äôs struggle for equality will live on forever."
One way to destroy Social Security is to underfund and understaff the Social Security Administration. That is what Republicans have been doing. I am glad to have helped lead the effort to reverse that situation. It's a start.

It's a beautiful day for the #MarchForOurLives in Montpelier. Thank you to the young people who are leading us today.
The Trump administration has shown once again that it is on the wrong side of history. There is a reason the administration has not provided any scientific evidence to justify this policy: there is no justification for this sort of discrimination.
I want to congratulate everyone who is participating in the #MarchForOurLives today. Congress must have the guts to listen to the vast majority of the American people and not just the NRA.
John Bolton is the next National Security Advisor. That should scare everyone. Here are four reasons why:
"It was true in 1993 and it is true now: the time is long, long overdue for the United States to join the rest of the industrialized world and have a universal health care system."
This was probably one of the most bizarre press conferences a president has ever had. Trump's hypocrisy and ignorance is no longer laughable. It is frightening.
The American people are tired of our broken health care system. Poll after poll shows that the majority of Americans know that we can do better and that we should pass Medicare for all to finally make health care a right.
John Bolton was part of the effort to mislead the US into the disastrous Iraq war and has supported military action against North Korea and Iran. He was too extreme to be confirmed as UN ambassador in 2005 and is absolutely the wrong person to be national security advisor now.
"""There virtually has never been a substantial black middle class, if we're defining it in terms of wealth."" - @DarrickHamilton"

Our job is to stand together and say: Mr. Trump, in this country we believe in democracy, not authoritarianism."
"What was the corporate media discussing while we were talking about inequality in America? Let me guess, Stormy Daniels."
"I'm deeply disappointed that Congress again abdicated its constitutional duty to authorize war. Over and over, Congress has sat back and failed to ask the hard questions as administrations have misled us into conflicts, including Vietnam and Iraq, with disastrous consequences."
6 months after Hurricane Maria we are still seeing a humanitarian crisis with schools being closed and people struggling to get clean drinking water. 1 in 10 people in Puerto Rico still have no electricity ‚Äì in the wealthiest nation on earth. That is a disgrace.
"The truth about Yemen is that U.S. forces have been actively engaged in support of the Saudi coalition in this war, providing intelligence and aerial refueling of planes whose bombs have killed thousands of people and made this humanitarian crisis far worse."
"LBJ‚Äôs administration misled Congress and the American people into the Vietnam War, just as the Bush administration misled us into the Iraq War. 

Time and again we see disasters when leaders refuse to tell the truth and when Congress is not actively involved in finding the truth."
The American people were lied to and misled by the Bush administration into believing that the Iraq war was necessary to prevent another 9/11. And Congress did not challenge them on those claims the way it should have.
Let me give you two reasons why Congress must reassert its constitutional authority over war: the war in Iraq and the war in Vietnam. In both wars Congress sat back and failed to ask the hard questions as two administrations led us into conflicts with disastrous consequences.
"So far as a result of the Saudi-led war in Yemen:
-Over 10,000 civilians have been killed
-Over 3 million have been displaced
-15 million people lack access to clean water and sanitation
-More than 1 million cases of cholera have been reported"
"I expect that colleagues today will be arguing that we are not really engaged in the Saudi-led war in Yemen. Well, tell that to the people of Yemen, whose homes and lives are being destroyed by weapons marked ‚ÄúMade in the USA,"" dropped by planes refueled by the U.S. military."
"The Founding Fathers gave the power to authorize military conflicts to Congress, the branch most accountable to the people. For far too long Congress, under Democratic and Republican administrations, has abdicated its Constitutional role in authorizing war."
Congress must reassert its Constitutional authority over the issue of war
"For far too long Congress, under Democratic and Republican administrations, has abdicated its Constitutional role in authorizing war. That is the debate we are going to have today."

"We need to ask the hard questions that the corporate media fails to ask: who owns America, and who has the political power? Why, in the richest country in the history of the world are so many Americans living in poverty?"
"I was proud to have worked with Rep. Louise Slaughter during my 16 years in the U.S. House of Representatives. Throughout her career, Louise was a leading figure in the fight for economic, social and racial justice. She will be missed by her constituents and the entire country."
Monday night at 7 PM ET we are holding an incredibly important town hall on the rise of oligarchy and the collapse of the middle class. I hope you will join us.
"Today is the last day to apply for summer internships with Senator Sanders in his Burlington and Washington, DC offices. See here for more information:"

"If you want to know why the American people have so much contempt for what goes on in Congress it is because time after time after time, the Republican leadership in Congress is doing the exact opposite of what the American people want."
"Next Monday, March 19th, we will be live streaming a discussion the likes of which you'd never see in the mainstream media. I hope you will tune in."
What kind of message does it send when a defense contractor is paid 100 times more than the secretary of defense? Corporate interests should never take precedence over the interests of taxpayers or our national security.
Thank you to the young people throughout this country who are walking out today and who have the courage to do what the United States Congress is not doing: lead us forward to stop the slaughter that we have seen from coast to coast due to gun violence. #NationalWalkoutDay
"Many Americans are unaware that the people of Yemen are suffering today in a devastating civil war, or that U.S. forces have been actively engaged in support of the Saudi coalition in this war."
Firing the secretary of state by tweet is no way to run a foreign policy. Countries around the world are looking to the U.S. for signs of stability and leadership. Trump is sending the opposite message.
"Here's the good news: since November 2012, more than 20 states and 40 cities and counties have raised their minimum wages. We're winning the fight for a living wage."
This is what happens when you have a multi-billionaire who has never attended or taught in a public school as the secretary of education.
"Unbelievably, Congress right now wants to deregulate some of the same banks that helped cause the 2008 financial disaster. That is really unacceptable."
The Trump budget is just the Republican three-step dance. My friend @RepJayapal breaks it down.
"Loudly and clearly, we must tell Republicans leaders: no, we will not cut Social Security benefits for seniors and disabled veterans."
I couldn‚Äôt resist a chance to ask that CNN talk about the real issues affecting the American people.
"Today on #InternationalWomensDay‚Äîand every day‚Äîwe must commit to building a country and world where all women are safe, have equal opportunity and the social, racial and economic justice they deserve. We will not go backward on women's rights. We will move forward."
The CEO of Honeywell made 333 times the amount of money as the company's median worker last year. That is an outrage.
"Wealth and income inequality is the great moral, political and economic issue of our time, yet it gets very little coverage from the corporate media. Join me, @SenWarren, @MMFlint and more on March 19 for an in-depth conversation on inequality in America."
"Charles Koch wrote in the Washington Post today that ""we should all question the fairness of the system"" when companies can pressure politicians. Well, here's how billionaires like the Kochs use their wealth to influence our political system and give themselves tax breaks:"
"Charles Koch to Paul Ryan: Here's $500K for giving me a massive tax cut at working families' expense.

Also Charles Koch: ‚ÄúWhen large companies can pressure politicians to force everyday Americans to fork over unearned millions, we should all question the fairness of the system.‚Äù"
A multinational corporation taking huge sums of money from taxpayers should not be paying workers starvation wages. I stand with the workers who are fighting back against low wages and wage theft.
"What issue do you think got more coverage on CNN today, the effort to deregulate the major banks or Donald Trump and a porn star? Think hard!"
"Does it make sense that we pay the Secretary of Defense $200,000 or less and we give a contractor, who gets 92 percent of his revenue from the taxpayers of this country, $18 million in taxpayer money?"
"The Koch brothers and other right-wing groups are trying to destroy unions in America, and that's exactly what the Janus Supreme Court case is about."
"I am excited to have @keithellison take the lead in the House on the fight to pass a Medicare-for-all health care system. With his leadership, I know we will be able to take on the greed of health insurance and pharmaceutical companies and finally guarantee health care to all."
"I have a radical idea. Instead of listening to lobbyists in Washington, maybe, just maybe, we should listen to the American people who believe we should strengthen, not weaken, Wall Street regulations."
"Since the 1990s, the financial sector has given more than $3.2 billion in campaign contributions, and last year spent over $200 million on lobbying. That is why Congress will be spending day after day trying to make life easier for large financial institutions."
"Why is Congress busy worrying about the needs of huge financial institutions, but ignores the concerns of ordinary Americans? The answer is simple. Follow the money."
"I hear from a lot of people in Vermont and around the country. I have not heard one person say, ""Bernie, we have got to deregulate 25 of the largest banks in this country with cumulative assets of $3.5 trillion."" Yet that is what Congress is debating doing today."
Today my Republican colleagues along with some Democrats tell us that we should be spending our time deregulating some of the largest banks in America. How absurd is that?
